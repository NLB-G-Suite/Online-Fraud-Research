found the one and only thing that has brought me thousands of dollars of monthly income. It was a slow process but after a couple of days of doing this you go from $1 a day up to $25 a day then up to $100 a day!\n\nSign up here. They have multiple payout options such as paypal, payza and more\nLink: http://www.neobux.com/?r=dirven\n*Update: Decided to take a screenshot of my account. I have low account balance because i just cashed out recently but as you can see I have received over $6000: http://imgur.com/NcIH1y8\n\nEarn money just by clicking ads. The way it works is advertisers want you to visit their webpage and you get money just by visiting their websites. Here is a little step by step guide.\n\n1.) Save enough money by clicking ads then rent 3 referrals\n2.) Earn money from referrals\n3.) Rent MORE referrals\n4.) Cashout \n5.)

If the answer is yes, it is quite likely that you have invested countless hours researching how to make money while working a flexible schedule from the comfort of your own home. While all that research may not yet have been successful in yielding the kind of life-changing income you\u2019ve been seeking, there is at least one site that provides a very real opportunity to generate thousands of dollars each and every month through a simple system that requires very little effort on your part. That site is Sevendollarclick.com, where I have been bringing in an average of $7,000 to $8,000 per month for the past two years.\n\nBefore signing up for Sevendollarclick.com, I too had spent a great deal of time seeking a new work opportunity, hoping that I could find out how to make money online without having to accept any reduction in my income. While performing search after search on how to make money, I began looking into pay-to-click websites, or PTCs, as I believed that this was the best option for someone looking for a way to bring in consistently exceptional income without having to make a massive commitment of time and energy.\n\nHaving previously worked in marketing, I was quite well aware of how much revenue online advertising was capable of generating and how valuable the views and clicks of those advertisements could be, so I spent quite a bit of time looking into all of the details I could find about the PTCs I had discovered with the goal of analyzing the potential income possible through each one. After a detailed analysis of each site, I selected Sevendollarclick.com, which I felt offered the greatest opportunity for generating substantial monthly earnings while requiring a relatively minimal investment of time on my part. At a rate of $7 per click, it is not all that difficult to understand how to make money quickly and easily through the intuitive PTC system made available through Sevendollarclick.com.\n\nIn this video, I detail my personal experience with Sevendollarclick.com and delineate the simple strategies I have used over the last two years to take home over $7,000 in income on a monthly basis. This includes instructions regarding how to sign up for the website and how to make money online just by clicking the advertisements Sevendollarclick.com makes accessible through its website. The membership guidelines and payout options are also discussed in detail, and I have included an overview of the company\u2019s consistency in making payments available to its members in a timely fashion along with any other relevant information you might be interested in learning while researching how to make money online.\n\nMy experience with Sevendollarclick.com could not have been any smoother. Just over two years ago, I found this PTC website and took the few moments necessary to sign up and log in before being able to access the advertisements. Once I was logged in, I started clicking advertisements immediately and kept at it until I had met the $7,000-threshold for payment. Having purchased a membership shortly after signing up for the site, the withdraw button was already visible to me and payout was available following the agreed-upon 75-day waiting period.\n\nDuring that initial 75-day window, I continued to click on the ads made accessible to me through Sevendollarclick.com and have since enjoyed a steady income of at least $7,000 per month, which has always been credited to my account on time. All you need to do to have a similar experience to mine is to follow the simple guidelines outlined by Sevendollarclick.com and to invest a relatively minimal amount of time and effort to consistently click on the ads, after which you can just sit back and enjoy all of the possibilities suddenly available to you when you are compensated at a rate of $7 per click.", "Click Here to Signup: https://goo.gl/sLaJ2a\nRecently Payment Proof: http://prntscr.com/h30tp4\n\nPaidverts is one of the top and best PTC site nowadays in terms of earning. It's become very easy now to make or earn $20 to $30 daily by clicking ads view on paidverts. You can increase your earning by the following methods.\n\nBAP View Activation Ads\nCash Offers\nGames\nRefer Friends\n\nBAP view activation ads does active your daily ads view.

You don't need to have any experience or skill in writing to do this method. All you need to do is share your funny idea and the website will even help you to create it. It's available worldwide and you just need pc or laptop and internet connection to do this. Try it now!\n\nWhere do I start?\n\nFrom the main page, look in the upper right corner of the window, \nclick where it says WRITE FOR US (link below). There's a blue button that invites you to join the private message board where people submit their article pitches. \n\nClick the little person icon on the far right, and that'll bring up the basic \"Login or Register\" window. \n\n\nHow much do I get paid?\n\nFor your first four accepted articles, you will get $150 each. From your fifth article onward, you will get $250. If your article becomes one of the ten highest traffic-pullers of the month, you'll earn an additional bonus payment of $100.\n\nWhen will I actually get the money?\n\nUsually three to 10 days after submission. You don't have to wait until the article is published -- you turn it in, we show you how to fill out the invoice, it gets processed. Ask anybody -- we're good about paying quickly.\n\nHow do I get my money?\n\nYou will need a PayPal account in order to get paid, and the first time you're published, you'll need to fill out a simple online tax form. It's pretty easy. Once you fill out those forms for the first time, you shouldn't ever have to do it again.\n\nI don't have any experience in writing. Can I still do this?\n\nAbsolutely. You don't need to have experience or a degree. You just have to have ideas. Moderators and editors will help you through the process. Many of our highest-traffic articles were written by people who had never before published a single word. Some of them were still in high school.\n\nIs all of this a scam? Are you just harvesting contact info for spam or identity theft reasons?\n\nIf so, we're apparently playing a very long con -- we've been publishing public submissions for about a decade now (since mid 2007) and we are owned by E.W. Scripps, a media company that has been in business since 1878. We have very high standards for what we publish, and that's always been the key to our success. If it's good, your work will be seen by a few hundred thousand to a couple million people.\n\nSign up to Cracked \u27a1\ufe0f http://www.cracked.com/write-for-cracked/\n\nHow do I submit an article?\n\nYou'll just be showing us your idea at first. If it's accepted, we'll have you write up the full article later. To submit a pitch, click this link http://forums.cracked.com/viewforum.php?f=20&sid=8378d7b90fafc71f4fc40d510c947a86 , which takes you to the Cracked Comedy Workshop (again, it won't be visible unless you do the steps above first). You'll see a whole bunch of threads full of advice and archives of accepted articles. You can read around in there all you like, but for now, scroll down until you see the \"New Topic\" button:\n\nClick that, and pitch your idea. A moderator will then come into the thread you created and give you more instructions, showing you how the pitch process works.\n\n- John\n\nConnect with me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nLike our Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nJoin Our Private Group To get help: https://www.facebook.com/groups/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/johnmichaeljmm\nAdd us on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/johnminspires\n\nEarnings Disclaimer:\u00a0\nhttps://www.johnmichaelmarketing.com/earnings-disclaimer/\n\nShare this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl304ERRdi8\nRecommended video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSxc_aZlLp4\n\nSOURCE: http://www.cracked.com/blog/how-to-make-money-doing-stuff-cracked-no-bs-guide/\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad------------------------------------------------------\nSTEP 1.

Lesser known these methods may be but they are definitely not less profitable.\n\nPPC or Pay Per Click is exactly what it sounds like. You put an ad on your site. If someone clicks on the ad you get paid.\nThe Pay Per Click market is dominated by Google Adsense. Adsense serves up ads that are relevant to a page\u2019s content and to a visitors browsing history.\n\n- Adsense works well with large amounts of untargeted traffic. Like say on a news site.\n- You can expect to make 10 cents to $2 per click, depending on your niche.\n- Many websites use Adsense because it\u2019s so easy.

After being promoted the youngest Vice President in the trading division of Barclays Bank headquarters in London UK, he realized there was more to life than working for \"the man\". \n\nHe went on to build, scale and sell five separate, six-figure a year digital publishing and education businesses. He then merged his passion for finance and for the internet by co-founding 8020Research.com - the No 1 publishing house dedicated to helping people live the life they dream, desire and deserve by leveraging the Internet. \n\nThe income generated from these online businesses allowed him to buy and sell five properties in the UK, drive some of the nicest cars, and get on some of the most incredible adventures in the world such as the TransSiberian Railway, drinking vodka with the country\u2019s top trader and his family on 3 separate trips to Mongolia, drinking Steins of beer in Oktoberfest, Germany with the locals for 3 years in a row, partying with (mostly) Australians at the Run of the Bulls (Spain) on 3 separate years, and the list could go on. \n\n\"Formal education will make you a living, self education will make you a fortune\" \n\nAfter investing $150,000 into his own trading education and self-improvement, he became financially free by the age of 35 and is now on a mission to help 100,000 average people take back control of growing and protecting their wealth by December 31st, 2020 as the government, employers or the system certainly won't. \n\n\"Pay for mentors or pay for mistakes, your choice\" \n\nYoutube: http://8020research.com/yt \n\nKick-ass Facebook Community: http://8020research.com/fbgroup \n\nTop 3 Cryptos to Buy Today: http://8020research.com/top3-facebook https://twitter.com/8020tiz \n\nWeb: http://8020research.com", "Littlebux Make Money Online by Clicking", "Guys, this is another online money earning video.

According to a recent post in 'Small Business Trends' there are over 6.6 million plus home-based businesses that can make money from home. All these businesses require funding and increase website traffic, of some sort. Unless you can learn the business and get your startup capital from referrals revenue. Everything depends on the nature of the business.\n\nIn most cases you will need ways to make extra money.  Making money on the internet, will depend on the nature of the program. You often hear that it takes money to make money. It is better of course to start small in any case and expand your business as your profits grow. While you are starting a home-based business it's better to continue with your existing full or part time job and learn the art of patience before making any career decisions.\n\nBanks are a popular way to get funding. Although they have associated costs and risks, some use their existing contacts and rely on learning the business well enough to show and prove its success. The more homework you do on your business the more you reduce the risks to earn online.\n\nA proven home-based business called Profit Clicking is proving itself to be a very safe low risk venture to get paid online.

Advertisers buy clicks to their websites and program members earn a share of the revenue when they visit these websites. There is also a referral system in place so members can build downlines and earn from them.The Neobux program is one of many of these types of programs on the internet today. This is the very simple method to earn money by just click on ad's.You click on links, visit advertiser websites, stay on them for a certain period of time, and you earn money for it.\nHow to earn money by click on ad's on Neobux\nDon't rent any refs until you have earned 3 dollars (if you want things to go faster you can, of course invest some money). Transfer your 3 dollars from your \"Main Balance\" to your \"Rental Balance\". You now have 1 dollar per ref and you won't have any problems with recycling the inactive ones and/or with extending your refrells.This is where you enable \"AutoPay\"\nWhen you have purchased your first 3 refs, you should enable \"AutoPay\", which is a very good tool.

Visit today to get a FREE internet marketing course.\n\nPay per click advertising works the same across all platforms.  Meaning that platforms like Google, Bing, Yahoo all work under the same premise.\n\nAt its foundation, all that pay per click really is, is a auction where a number of advertisers bid against each other to show up on the top spot of a search engine in order to get you to see their website.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\nLet's say that the keyword that a number of advertisers wanted to bid on was \"Website Keyword Research Tool\".  Now, most of us know that keyword research is one of the most important things todo before ever creating a website.\n   \nFor those who don't know, keyword research is the act of trying to find the right keywords to focus on in your website in an effort to rank organically for them in search engines.  Keyword research is extremely important because if you are able to rank in the natural search results on keywords in search engines, you are able to consistently get traffic delivered to your website without paying for any marketing.\n\nSo, here is our keyword, \"website keyword research tool\".  \nAnd here are the 10 advertisers that want to compete to be shown in paid search results for \"website keyword research tool\".  In other words, all 10 of these companies have some sort of product or offering that they want individuals who are searching for a keyword research tool to see.  \n\nIn order to determine the best ad for the user, search engines look at three main factors.\n\nFirst, and not surprisingly, the search engine will look at how much money each company is willing to bid for that particular keyword.  Obviously, the higher the bid for a keyword, the more likely of a chance that the ad will be seen.\n\nSecond, the search engine looks at how relevant the keyword is to the ad being shown.  The thought here is that if an ad includes the actual search query that the user has typed in, the more likely it is that the product being advertised is what the user wants.  This makes sense because there isn't a company out there that want to create ads that are relevant to what they are trying to sell.\nThird, the search engine reviews the website landing page to ensure that the content on that page is relevant to the keyword and to the ad.  This ensures that companies don't bid on keywords and create ads are relevant and then lead the user to a page that is irrelevant to their original search query.\nWhen a user searches for this term, in fractions of a second the search engine will look at all of the advertisers competing , all three of these factors, and serve ads to the user.\n\nThe user is then shown 10 different ads with the most relevant and highest price ad on the top followed by ads below that which are paying less money or less relevant.\n\nFrom there, the user clicks, which costs the advertising website money, and then the user is brought to a landing page showcasing the product or offering that the company advertised.\nSo we are going to do now is we're going to do a screen share and I will show you exactly how this process works using Google.  I'm using Google because it accounts for roughly 70% of the search market share on the Internet and is the industry leader in serving ads for those who search for information on the Internet.\nOne thing that is important to note is that the keyword research tool that I use, which is called long tail Pro, doesn't do pay per click advertising and has relied on word-of-mouth to grow, so it isn't going to be listed in the search results.  If you want to know more about this keyword research tool, which has a free 10 day trial, then check outwww.OneHourProfessor.com/keywordtool.\nSo here we are in Google and we are going to search for \"website keyword research tool\".  Now once we do that you can see that there are numerous advertisers who are bidding on that particular keyword.\n\nAs I said before, Google has determined what ad should be shown by reviewing three main factors which are the bid, the relevancy of the ad, and the relevancy of the landing page.", "In this tutorial, I will NOT lie to you and say \"Refer me and you will earn 5 dollars for every ad you click!\"\r\n\r\nIt isn't that easy, but it is close.\r\n\r\nIf you don't feel like watching the whole in depth tutorial, then click this link: \r\nhttp://bux.to/?r=alcaponeben\r\n\r\nSign up, click ads, and make a little cash.

(Get Paid Fast & Easy PayPal Money - Best Free Sites 2017)", "Automatic blur background in 1 click : https://goo.gl/3iwsMw How to link blogger add  adsense & earn money ? || by technical naresh\n\nClick Here For More : https://goo.gl/q5MLY4 \n\nLinking your existing Google AdSense account to blogspot is very difficult because your newly created blogger blog will not get approved easily until and unless you have a successfully created a blog with many number of pages and many articles lying in it. Google AdSense becoming one of the top advertising firm in all over the world and also one of the reputed advertising platform. It is the dream of every blogger to use AdSense ads to monetize their blogs and websites.\n\nHow to Link Existing Google Adsense Account to New blogspot\n\nSuppose you created new blog in blogspot platform and you want to show Google AdSense ads in your new blogspot blog in that case you have a direct option inside the blogspot settings to monetize your blog by clicking the option earnings in your settings page of blogger. As soon as you click earnings option then you see Google AdSense page showing. In that Google AdSense page you will see an option called as sign-up for AdSense which won\u2019t allow you to click on that option because you can see that option but you can click that and next to the sign-up with Google AdSense option you\u2019ll see a message telling you that your blog doesn\u2019t qualify for Google AdSense.\n\nThis is the most common problem which is faced by all blogspot new bloggers. If your blog is fully ready with all the posts and every other thing than only you can click on this option sign up with Google AdSense at the time it will allow you to click on that. And for those who have already an existing AdSense account also to them even it won\u2019t allow you to link existing Google AdSense account to your blogspot blog.\n\nLink Existing Google Adsense Account to Blogspot\nNow I will unveil the truth. If you already have an Google AdSense account which you got from YouTube and also you run an other professional website or blog like www.sharedelete.com or www.xyz.com.

In order to see success with your ads and to make a high return on investment on your campaigns targeting plays a big part, for example if I was to run a campaign and I want to target people that are interested in wine, If typed in wine, it shows it has an audience of 8,900,000 and just by selecting wine it gives us an estimated reach of over 400,000 people, this is not the best practice when targeting your areas of interest. Most people on the Facebook Ad platform are doing multiple word dumps, their interests are un targeted and too generic. You want to use the Facebook search box and typing your keywords and see which fanpages come back relating to those keywords and then you can go and like those pages and use those as precise interests when using your targeting. And each fan page seems to have it own bid price, and most people I'm not doing micro niche targeting, their just typing in a word like wine and targeting everything underneath that category and this is possibly a reason why they are not receiving the highest conversions with their ads. \n\nIn order to see maximum results from your campaign the best strategy is to develop a landing page to match the keywords that you target. This way you will definitely see an increase in conversions.\n\nFacebook Golden Tactic number three: Split Test and Maximise your return. Now running any campaigns on Facebook one thing to sure is that you split-test your campaigns that means taking one campaign and splitting up into several different parts, so you could have one image and then you could duplicate the image onto another campaign and use a different title and different body text but keep on using the same image. Then you could duplicate that again use the same title and the same body text but changed image around. What happens here is you start to see which add is more effective with your audience, and therefore you can keep on scrapping out the ones that are not doing well and you can move over to the ones that are performing well and you can split them again. So make sure that you split test and find out that winning campaign.\n\nFacebook golden tactic number 4 capture the lead. \n\nI've noticed that many marketers fail to do this. They are not capturing the leads when running any of their Facebook campaigns. You should try to capture the lead of every single person that clicks on your Ad with the help of autoresponder services if you're not doing this within your campaigns you're seriously needing money on the table. And once you capture the lead that comes by clicking on your ad you can reach your customers by just sending out the single message whether its an email or as status update on your fanpage and in effect it can save you lots of money down the line. \u00a0\n\nNow for example if I was to run an ad on the Google ad network and I wanted to reach 50 people and they were charging me one dollar click it would cost me $50 to reach 50 people and lets say we're using Facebook Ad platform and we've run a campaign where 50 people have clicked on our Ad and if we are collecting the leads, those leads of those 50 people would then be saved into our database and we can then follow up with those 50 people are sending out a simple message an email and it will go out to those people and we won't have to spend $50 in future. \n\nSo this is something essential that you should be doing inside all of your campaigns.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNoR8HH4jZA", "Earn Money By Clicking And Breaking Egg \u25cf This App Scam or Not!\nEarn $5-$100 PayPal Cash By Breaking The Egg || Make Money -

In order to see success with your ads and to make a high return on investment on your campaigns targeting plays a big part, for example if I was to run a campaign and I want to target people that are interested in wine, If typed in wine, it shows it has an audience of 8,900,000 and just by selecting wine it gives us an estimated reach of over 400,000 people, this is not the best practice when targeting your areas of interest. Most people on the Facebook Ad platform are doing multiple word dumps, their interests are un targeted and too generic. You want to use the Facebook search box and typing your keywords and see which fanpages come back relating to those keywords and then you can go and like those pages and use those as precise interests when using your targeting. And each fan page seems to have it own bid price, and most people I'm not doing micro niche targeting, their just typing in a word like wine and targeting everything underneath that category and this is possibly a reason why they are not receiving the highest conversions with their ads. \n\nIn order to see maximum results from your campaign the best strategy is to develop a landing page to match the keywords that you target. This way you will definitely see an increase in conversions.\n\nFacebook Golden Tactic number three: Split Test and Maximise your return. Now running any campaigns on Facebook one thing to sure is that you split-test your campaigns that means taking one campaign and splitting up into several different parts, so you could have one image and then you could duplicate the image onto another campaign and use a different title and different body text but keep on using the same image. Then you could duplicate that again use the same title and the same body text but changed image around. What happens here is you start to see which add is more effective with your audience, and therefore you can keep on scrapping out the ones that are not doing well and you can move over to the ones that are performing well and you can split them again. So make sure that you split test and find out that winning campaign.\n\nFacebook golden tactic number 4 capture the lead. \n\nI've noticed that many marketers fail to do this. They are not capturing the leads when running any of their Facebook campaigns. You should try to capture the lead of every single person that clicks on your Ad with the help of autoresponder services if you're not doing this within your campaigns you're seriously needing money on the table. And once you capture the lead that comes by clicking on your ad you can reach your customers by just sending out the single message whether its an email or as status update on your fanpage and in effect it can save you lots of money down the line.  \n\nNow for example if I was to run an ad on the Google ad network and I wanted to reach 50 people and they were charging me one dollar click it would cost me $50 to reach 50 people and lets say we're using Facebook Ad platform and we've run a campaign where 50 people have clicked on our Ad and if we are collecting the leads, those leads of those 50 people would then be saved into our database and we can then follow up with those 50 people are sending out a simple message an email and it will go out to those people and we won't have to spend $50 in future. \n\nSo this is something essential that you should be doing inside all of your campaigns.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6ot8nHY3hc", "Here's exactly how to make money on youtube without ads, without monetization, without networks, without sponsors.\nYou don't need any of those if you do what I discuss in this video.\nProven and effective.\n\n\u201cWant to connect on facebook? Add me on Facebook: \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/aleksander.vitkin\n\nFollow me on Instagram: @aleksvitkin\u201d\n\nYou have probably seen other videos explaining how to make money on YouTube and they all say something about building a subscriber base, exchanging subscribers with other YouTubers and then getting paid by advertising or by sponsoring and you will be paid a few dollars per a thousand clicks.\n\nThat is the traditional way. That is not what I am going to talk about. That is not a very profitable business idea, unless you have hundreds of thousands of subscribers. I assume you do not and I do not have hundreds of thousands of subscribers either. \n\nI am going to give you a business model that works if you do not have hundreds of thousands of subscribers. You are going to be able to make more money with this business model than with adds on YouTube or anything like that. \n\nYou have probably never heard of this business model before. \n\nWhat if you took the people and instead of clicking the add they click on your link to go to your website. You can even have only a booking page on meetme.so (this is a website for booking pages), where they book a call with you. \n\nWhat is this call for? This call is not to just chat with you, but just to talk to you, so that you can give them a free consultation session and then you can sell them your coaching or a different product or service.\n\nWhy is this good? This is good, because even if you have a thousand of subscribers you will have enough people to build a six figure business. I am not talking random numbers here. This is what I have actually achieved. This is what actually works on YouTube. \n\nThis is what happens if you do not just focus on adds and hope that advertises pay you enough for your clicks to be able to make ends meet. This is making a real business and not just relying other people to send you a few dollars.\n\nWhat can you sell?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that you are an expert in one of the three big niches: health, wealth or money. How can you leverage your expertise into building a business and making money on YouTube?\n\nThe way to do that is to start making daily YouTube videos.\n\nIf you do not have a good camera, use your phone, put it on a tripod or hold it with your hand and have the light come to your face from a window. And then you start talking. \n\nYou can talk about subjects that you researched on Google keyword tool and you look up subjects in your niche. You have to create hundreds of videos in YouTube. This seems a lot of work and it is a lot of work.\n\nAsk people to subscribe to your YouTube channel. \n\nGenerally what happens is that you build a subscriber base and once in a while you make a video saying that you have an announcement and you are offering your coaching services. Then they will go to your link in an annotation or below in the description. \n\nThey will sign up to your call and then on the call you can sell them anything you want. And then you can learn how to deliver a service or a product. \n\nYou need to promote your videos on Facebook and slowly build an audience. This can explode any moment if one of your videos ranks on YouTube and suddenly you can get 300 subscribers per day.\n\nPeople are still hoping for those advertisement clicks, they sell their YouTube channels to networks. Even a channel with 170 000 subscribers earns only a couple of thousand dollars per month. That is not good compared to what you can do as a coach on YouTube who sells coaching or other packages or services on the phone to his YouTube subscribers. \n\nThis is a real business and this is how the big guys do it. If you can pull this off then do it, because I love this business model and so many people who I work with.\n\nThis is amazing business model and it is much better than YouTube adds.\n\nIf you like this video, please subscribe.

In the end, you'll have a great grasp of all the nuances of Google Ads.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nWhat Is Google Adsense?\n\nA program which of course belongs to Google. After you're accepted, you're able to easily integrate advertisement inside of your Youtube videos or website.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nHow Do You Get Approved?\n\nYou must pass a set of rules for you to receive Google approval this includes:\n\n- You have to be at least 18 years old\n- Your website can't be related to tobacco, drugs, adult oriented content\n\nFor more details read their official policy page here: https://support.google.com/adsense\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nHow Do You Earn Money With Google Adsense?\n\nThe advertisement displayed pays you in two different ways, such as:\n\n1. Clicks -  You receive a small amount of money each time someone clicks in your ad\n\n2 . Impressions - You also get money by someone simply seeing your ad.\n\nNote: The advertiser decides how they want to pay their ads.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nHow to Install Adsense on WordPress?\n\nYou have two methods to install Google Adsense on your WordPress website, such as:\n\n1. Manual Installation - You'll get a code after your created your advertisement in Google Adsense panel. Afterward, you must copy and paste it into your website.\n\nAn easy method is to simply insert a text widget in the sidebar, footer, or header section of your website. Next, just paste the coding there. \n\n2. Google Adsense Plugin Installation - I recommend for you to use this method if you're a novice. Just search for adsense plugin and install the one called, \"Google Adsense\".\n\nYou'll see a new section called, \"adsense\" in your settings. Next just connect your Google account to this plugin.

(Qmee Review)\n\nREAD ALL IMPORTANT INFO & SCROLL DOWN TO SIGN UP TO QMEE & GET STARTED :-)\n\nHow much will I earn?\n\nThere's no limit to how much you can earn. We offer you cash rewards for engaging with brands, as well as for sharing your opinion by answering surveys. Remember, we also save you money with access to thousands of automatic coupons and offers, and displaying price savings when we find you a better deal.\n\nYou can also earn even more by inviting your friends to join Qmee. Some Qmee users are earning thousands just by inviting their friends!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nOnce you have the Qmee extension installed in your desktop browser, it works in the background as your personal online shopping and saving companion. You'll see a Q in your browser toolbar that you can click on to see your balance at any time.\n\nYou can get cash rewards when you're searching on your favorite sites and engaging with brands you love. You can also get price savings when we find you a better deal with our automatic price comparison tool \u2013 all without having to go to different sites to compare, as well as coupons and deals. These appear as additional results on the left of your screen in the Qmee sidebar, on the sites you're already searching on. Just click on the results that interest you to earn cash or save money. \n\nHow is this possible?\n\nBrands pay to appear in Qmee's search results. This income is split between you, the shopper, and Qmee. This is an innovative model and at Qmee we want to put you back at the heart of the internet.\n\nWhat's the catch? There's no such thing as money for nothing\u2026\n\nThere isn't a catch - you get more when shopping and searching online with Qmee. You earn cash when you search for what you want online by clicking and engaging on results related to brands you love. We provide you with the ability to discover new brands, compare pricing or secure money-saving coupons for products and services you want to purchase. \n\nDoes Qmee change the search results I see?\n\nNo. You still see exactly the same results from your usual search engine as anyone who doesn't use Qmee - the only difference is that you see some extra ones that earn you money, show you price comparisons on the items you're shopping for and offer you great money-saving deals and coupons if you choose to click on them.\n\nI've just joined, why am I not seeing any results?\n\nWe only show results when we have something relevant to show you, so we won't appear all the time or every time you search. Qmee gives the best results when you're searching normally and clicking on results that interest you. This gives you the most rewards but also allows the business that list with us a chance to connect with you.\n\n\nCreate your Qmee account here \u27a1\ufe0f https://www.qmee.com/register\n\n\nAs always if you got value please like and subscribe!\n- John\n\nConnect with me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nLike our Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nJoin Our Private Group To get help: https://www.facebook.com/groups/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/johnmichaeljmm\nAdd us on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/johnminspires\n\nEarnings Disclaimer:\u00a0\nhttps://www.johnmichaelmarketing.com/earnings-disclaimer/\n\nShare this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuZjmnepv-E\nRecommended video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP-YMOslNrM\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad------------------------------------------------------\nSTEP 1.

You choose a type of product that you want to promote.\n2. Register for the affiliate program.\n3. Get an affiliate link (which is a special link that tracks all the purchases made by the people using your link).\n4. Promote this link.\n5. Earn a commission when people buy from it.\n\nThere a dozen of affiliate programs available on the internet. But the most popular ones in India is from Amazon and Flipkart.\n\nThe best part about Amazon is that:\n\nYou earn a commission even when someone makes a purchase on not only the product you\u2019re promoting but on any one or more product that the person buys from amazon within 24 hours, after clicking your link.\n\nThis means that you\u2019ll get a commission on not only the product that you\u2019re promoting but on all the products sold in amazon.\n\nThis is because when a person clicks on your affiliate link, a special \u2018cookie\u2019 gets stored in the browser for 24 hours and all the purchases made by him in that time limit, is credited to you!\n\nBut, How to promote this link ?\n\nYou can do it, in a number of ways. But the best and the most reliable way is by creating your own website. Let's start\n\nStep 1: Choose the type of product you want to promote\n\nFirst visit this page on amazon and select a category.\n\nChoose a category in which you\u2019re most interested in.\n\nThis is very important because what you choose here, will be the topic of your website in the next step.\n\nChoosing a topic helps you to write similar kind of articles for your audience easily. This is also called as \u2018choosing your niche\u2019.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected your topic/category, you can go to the next step.\n\nSTEP 2: Creating a Website\n\nWe\u2019ve done another video which will help you to launch your website in 5-10 mins.\n\nWatch that tutorial here: https://youtu.be/4aWkqe4O9kE\n\nSTEP 3: Sign-up for the Affiliate Program\n\nNow, once you\u2019ve created your own website, you can sign-up for the affiliate program. \n\nYou can choose an affiliate program based on the highest commissions paid by them for your topic (the category you\u2019ve chosen).\n\n\nSTEP 4: \n\nSelect the item you\u2019re going to promote\n\nAfter you become an affiliate, the next step is to select the item you\u2019re going to promote.\n\nIf you already know the type of product you\u2019re going to promote, then go ahead by searching the product name in  the \u2018search box\u2019.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an idea about the product you\u2019re going to promote, then you can \n\nFollow these simple steps:\n\n1. First go to amazon India bestsellers page.\n2. Select your category from the left side.\n3. You\u2019ll see the best selling products on this page. Now, choose the one that has a rating above 4 stars.\n4. Also, take a look at the features and read the user reviews to get an idea about the product.\n\nIf you like it, go to the next step,\u201dWriting an article about the product.\u201d\n\nSTEP 5\nWrite content about the product\n\nNow you can start writing an article based on the product you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nLet me show you a type of article you can write:-\n\n1. Go to the Wordpress site, you\u2019ve created.\n2. Click New & Post\n3. Now write an article about the product you\u2019ve chosen (You can also learn the different types of content you can write, by clicking here).\n4. Make sure that you\u2019ve read all the product features and user reviews to list down the pros & cons of the product.\n5. Add an image.\n\nNow comes the important part :- Adding your Affiliate Link\n\n1. First find a \u2018Buy button\u2019 from Google images.\n2. Then add it in your article.\n3. Now go to the product page in amazon and click \u2018link to this page\u2019 which appears in the top grey bar.\n4. Right click in the \u2018live preview\u2019 option and copy the link address (This is your affiliate link).\n5. Go to the article and click the \u2018Buy button\u2019 & then click \u2018Edit\u2019.\n6. Select link to custom URL and paste your affiliate link.\n7. Also, check open link in a new tab.\n8. Click Update and click Publish to post the article.\n\nNow go to the article and click the buy button. Clicking it, will take you to the amazon product page. \n\nThis means your affiliate link is working.\n\nNow when a person makes a purchase by clicking this buy button, you\u2019ll get a commission.\n\nThis is how you can promote products, using your affiliate link.\n\nQuick Tip:- Make sure you write article which provides some kind of benefit to your readers. This will attract more visitors to your site.", "How to earn money online in telugu | easy money online | \u0c35\u0c3e\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c38\u0c3e\u0c2a\u0c4d \u0c24\u0c4b \u0c21\u0c2c\u0c4d\u0c2c\u0c41 \u0c38\u0c02\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c26\u0c28 \u0c0e\u0c32\u0c3e ? | Make money from whatsapp status - telugu \n\nDescription:-\n\nHello friends in these video we will discuss about how to make money from whatsapp status in telugu.\n\nI had explained about a site that pays a lot to their customers that is whtasappstatustus.com website.\n\nHere you can make money from this whatsappstatus.com\nJust by writing Simple whatsapp status.You can select your category & write. \n\nOn these site we can do various things We have Coolest collection of Whatsapp Status.\n\n At Whatsstatus.com you get best Whatsapp Status in Hindi & English.

A clickdetector is used for when you want to give a brick the ability to be clicked. This offers many levels of customisation as to what happens after the brick has been clicked. in this tutorial, I create a clickdetector which changes the colour of a Roblox block when clicked. Due to the rise in exploits in Roblox, ClickDetectors stop working when FilteringEnabled (the anti-exploit feature which Roblox added) is turned on. This video uses RemoteEvents to fix this and allow them to work even with FilteringEnabled turned on.\n\nOn my YouTube channel, I create videos which help people of any age to learn how to script on Roblox.

This is a common question asked and it really depends on who you ask.  You may have heard that you\u2019ll make one dollar per thousand views or that it\u2019s $1,000 per Million Views.  Some say it\u2019s $5 per thousand views.  Well, we\u2019re asking the wrong question.  We should be asking, \u201cHow much ENGAGEMENT does it take to make money on YouTube?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t make money based on the amount of views you have.  You make money based on people\u2019s engagement with the ad.  Engagement here means clicking or watching a ad for more than 30 seconds.  YouTube Advertising is managed in the Adwords platform. Advertisers choose ads on a Cost Per Click (CPC) or Cost Per View (CPV) model.\n\nCPC is when an advertiser pays money based on clicks.  So if a certain keyword has a CPC of $3 and someone clicks on that ad, it will charge that advertiser $3. These text ads pop up in the lower part of the screen during the video and can also show up as a square banner on the right side of your channel.\n\nUnderstand this, Certain KeyWords Pay More than Others.  Advertisers will pay more for the keyword, \u201chome mortgage\u201d (CPC $17.63) than \u201ccheap phone cases\u201d (CPC $1.38) because the end return is a lot higher.  If someone ends up closing on a home loan that could make them upwards of $5,000+, whereas the end return on a cheap phone case would only be $15. technicalnaresh,technical naresh,make money fiverr,fiverr, youtube,blog,fiverr gig,fiverr tips,fiverr tricks,fiverr review,fiverr tricks 2018,how to rank fiverr gig,fiverr orders,fiverr gigs ranking,fiverr success formula,fiverr search results,fiverr gig ranking,fiverr gig rank,rank fiverr gig,fiverr gig seo,fiverr 2018, rank you gig on fiverr, optimize fiverr gigs,5 Ways to earn Money,make money online,earn Money,fiverr reviews,fiverr seo Would you rather get paid from a phone case video that gets a million views with a CTR of 0.01% or a home mortgage video that only gets 10,000 views with a CTR of 0.08% ?  Consider the scenarios below with the given keywords and their cost per clicks.\n\nScenario 1 You make a video reviewing the new iPhone that gets 1,000,000 views, of which your ad Click Through Rate (CTR) is 0.1%.  Meaning 1,000 people clicked the ad.  If the CPC is $1.38 the total advertising dollars made would be $1,380.  Google keeps around 45% making your payout $759.

or inbox me\nTHANKYOU", "Check out my CASE STUDY VIDEO at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il9mAoBOX6o You'll learn how a single YouTube video generates affiliate sales on autopilot.\n\nDid you know you can earn a lot more money on youtube promoting an affiliate product than earning money from adsense ads on your videos?\n\nYouTube receives billions of views every day so why not utlilize some of that traffic to promote an affiliate product on youtube?\n\n1. Look for an affiliate program to promote\nGo to clickbank.com\nClick on affiliate marketplace\nYou can search for products in the search box \nI'm going to click on \"software services\"\nOk here's the product \"instabuilder 2.0 The Ultimate Wordpress Marketing Plugin\"\nSo if you want to promote that just click on \"promote\"\nYou've got to set up an account with Clickbank\nSo I can earn 50% for each paying customer that I refer to this product.\nClick \"create\"\nHere's the affiliate link to the product\nIf I want to paste the link on my web page just copy this URL and paste it in my web page.\n\nOther affililate programs you can take a look at include JV ZOO, Amazon, Conversant, even Walmart.\n\n2. Do keyword research\nOne of the easiest keyword phrases would be \"product review\" so in this case you would choose \"instabuilder review\" as your keyword phrase.\n\nPut that keyword phrase into youtube you already see 9000 results of people using that same keyword phrase\nI would suggest getting more creative and finding a way to rank your video for a different keyword phrase\nSo let's go to the keyword planner\nOk here's the google keyword planner\nSearch for new keywords\nIf we go to the sales page we can choose a different kind of keyword phrase\nSo let's look at \"drag and drop software\"\nPut that in the keyword planner\nClick \"get ideas\"\nHere I've got  one \"drag and drop website builder\"\n\nIf we look at the top of the results we can see a number of videos here already it's not using exactly the phrase \"drag and drop website builder\". Many of them are over 1 year old.\n\n3. Create a short review video about your affiliate product\nA quick way to create a review video is to simply go to your sales page and then record the screen of the sales page, \nScroll through it and talk about the main features of the product\nYou can use a free online screen recording software like screencast-o-matic to record the sales page.\n\n4. Add a call to action at the end of your video\nAdd a graphic to the end of your review video that gets viewers to click the link in the description.\n\n5. Optimize your video so it will rank in the search engines\nMake sure you include your keyword phrase in the title, description and tags of your video\nKeep your privacy settings on private until you're ready to publish the video.\n\n6. Publish your video\nAfter you've finished optimizing the video simply set your privacy settings to public and publish the video. In this case I've published it already so I'll just click \"save changes\"\n\n7. Promote your video\nAfter you've published the video go down to the \"share\" button and share it on the social media sites.\n\nOther methods of promotion include embedding your video on your blog, notifying your email list, sharing your video on related facebook groups, froums and google plus communities.\n\nKeep in mind it may take a few days for your video to rank depending on the competitiveness of your keywords. If it doesn't rank on youtube or google within a week or 2 start an incoming links campaign to boost its rankings.\n\nEvery time someone purchases the product by clicking on the affiliate link in your video you'll receive a commission. The beauty of this process is that you get paid over and over again.\n\nCheck on my case study  video \"How a single youtube video generates affiliate sales on autopilot\"\n\nShare this video\nHow To Earn Money On YouTube Promoting An Affiliate Product\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLLaVA5ikec\n\nHow to make money on YouTube - Top 5 Ways\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCMfjxswa9k&index=1&list=PLFz7YaZ-5zVA0alp5Z2oWUbBP87aFM_sv\n\nHow to monetize YouTube videos using Google Adsense\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5oLc35xAT0", "You will learn on how to earn money here by writing AWESOME SLOGANS.

Many scammers use this by making a link seem like it goes somewhere you would want to go, and then bringing you to an advertisement page, or potentially virus/malware/phishing etc page.\n\nLuckily, it is very easy to find where the link will take you too, as well as some cool statistics for the link (amount of clicks and timeline) without having to go to the page. Then, once you've decided it's safe, you can go to where it was pointing you.\n\nBasically, just copy the short link, paste it into the url bar, and then add a + to the end of it. This works for almost all short link generators, and definitely all the reputable ones. \n\nPewdiepie's video that I mentioned in this video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCy281yQui4\n\nBasically, he was mostly giving Youtube flak for their poor commenting system, but he briefly mentions the short link issue. It is a big deal, because these spam comments exist because the people posting them are making money off of them. If people stopped clicking them, then the spammers would cease to make money, and then would stop posting spam, because they wouldn't have a reason to. This would definitely help make the Youtube comments a better place.\n\nSo, don't click short links, unless you know where they go, or they are from someone you trust. Report/dislike any comments you find that have spam short links.\n\nCheck out my facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/pages/All-How-2s/198429346974010\n\nor my twitter: https://twitter.com/AllHow2s\n\nOr my website where I have a lot of other great tutorials (such as how to take a screenshot, or how to get the start button back on Windows 8): http://www.allhow2s.com", "Attention: NOT PAYING NA PO SI CORTANA pero pwede nyo paring gawin itong procedure para sa iba pang clicking app.\n\nplease SUBSCRIBE!! https://goo.gl/zuVGk3\nplease SUBSCRIBE!! https://goo.gl/zuVGk3\nplease SUBSCRIBE!! https://goo.gl/zuVGk3\n\n===================================\n\nSa wala pang COINS.PH, register and get verified here:\nhttps://coins.ph/m/join/438u2r\nhttps://coins.ph/m/join/438u2r\nhttps://coins.ph/m/join/438u2r\n\n===================================\n\nHello guys!

The channel grows quickly because we use titles like \n\nHow to X in Y Time without Z\n\nHow to lose weight in 7 days without going to the gym.\nDrop belly fat in 21 days without giving up your favorite foods. \n\nTitles like that and good tags and the videos start to take on traffic. \n\nSo now the money part.

The main purpose of the script is to award currency every few seconds to players in your game forever. The tutorial focuses on firstly creating a leaderboard and then scripting the currency giver which is customizable to your needs, for example, you can change the currency name, the amount you want to give and the delay in seconds until it gives out more currency.You may have already seen these in popular Roblox games such as tycoons; they are great for creating auto money givers if you have a tycoon game. The script also works very well in roleplaying games, but it's a great addition to any game.

YES, it does! I don't know how much clearer I can make it.\n\nFAQs:\n\n1) It has been 2 days without payment. How can I contact them?\nEmail them: help@makemoney.tech\n\n2) What does \"In Review\" mean?\nYour account is being reviewed - it's nothing bad. It's just something that happens if the app's algorithm for tracking credits can't verify how you got yours. It's nothing bad. We've all had this status.\n\n3) What does \"Pending\" mean?\nJust means they're looking at your account to make sure you've followed their requirements for earning credits. Most likely you have been but I'm sure there are people out there looking for \"scammy\" ways to take advantage of this app.\n\n4) Do I need to use PayPal? \nYes. That's the only way (at the moment) to get paid.\n\n5) How can I earn more credits?\nBlast your referral link on social media websites, create videos talking about the application (and your experience with it), etc. It's really easy to do! I've referred over 650 people and you could too. Just start sharing your referral link.\n\nIf you don't have a referral link, you need to sign up first. Create your account by clicking this link (http://bit.ly/mmm-moneyapp) and signing up. Once you've created your account, you'll find your referral link under the \"Invite\" tab.

And so that's what we have here: a room full of phones relentlessly rating apps and writing BS reviews because everything in life (and particularly on the internet) is a lie. \n\nA Russian man visited a Chinese click farm. They make fake ratings for mobile apps. He said they have 10,000 more phones.\n\nA Russian Went Inside A Chinese Click-Farm: This Is What He Found\n\nOn the day when Snapchat erased billions of market cap from investors (and founders) accounts - as the MAUs-means-money model seems to break - we thought it worthwhile taking another glimpse into the hush-hush world of 'click-farms' and the fakeness of the latest social network fads.\n\nSo, if they're not human, where do all those \"likes,\" \"retweets,\" and \"followers\" lighting up your social media accounts from?\n\nThanks to this Russian gentleman - who visited a Chinese click farm, where they make fake ratings for mobile apps and other things like this -  we now know...\n\nHe said they have 10,000 more phones just like these.\n\nAs we concluded previously, the bottom line is simple: \"The illusion of a massive following is often just that,\" said Tony Harris, who does social media marketing for major Hollywood movie firms, said he would love to be able to give his clients massive numbers of Twitter followers and Facebook fans, but buying them from random strangers is not very effective or ethical. And once the prevailing users of social networks grasp that one of the main driving features of the current social networking fad du jour is nothing but a big cash scam operating out of a basement in the far east, expect both Facebook and shortly thereafter, Twitter, to go the way of 6 Degrees, Friendster and MySpace, only this time the bagholders will be the public. Because \"it is never different this time.\" The only certain thing: someone will promptly step in to replace any social network that quietly fades into the sunset.\n\nInside China's phoney 'click farm': Tiny office uses 10,000 handsets to send fake ratings and 'likes' for boosting clients' online popularity.", "Click, tap & collect cash to become rich and famous in this business adventure!\n\nCash is the name of the game in Cash, Inc. the ultimate cash clicker game!

Every time someone views or clicks on an ad you get paid.\n\nHere are the steps to monetize your videos on YouTube using Google Adsense:\n\n1.Become a YouTube Partner\n\nLog into your YouTube account by clicking on your profile \nClick Creator Studio\nClick the channel\nAnd here you can see I've already got partner verified. If you're not a YouTube partner yet then watch the video at the end of this video. Once your account status is partner verified  you'll see all these green buttons\n\n2. Enable monetization\n\nSo you can see here I've already got monetization enabled \nYou go to \"view monetization settings\"\nYou can monetize all your videos or you can go to video manager and monetize a single video. If you see a green button besides the video it means it's monetized\n\n3. Link your YouTube account to your Adsense account\n\nSo to do that  click on channel go to view monetization settings\nClick on \"how will I be paid\"\nClick on the link \"associate an Adsense account\"\nIt says \"you will be directed to Adsense to link your existing Adsense account or create a new one if you do not have one yet\"\nClick next\n\nStep 1. You can use an existing Google account to sign into Google Adsense or you can create a new Google account. So I have an existing Google account  so click sign in \n\nStep 2 Tell use about your content \nClick \"accept association\" \nSays \"redirecting you back to YouTube\"\nHere it says \"Adsense Association...the adsense account is now approved\"\n\nHow do you view your adsense earnings?\n\nYou can review your adsense earnings  by clicking on Analytics on your dashboard \nClick on \"estimated earnings\"\nYou're not going to see any earnings yet if you've just associated your adsense account to your YouTube account. So check again in a few days.\n\nSo how much money can you make?\n\nThe two key earning factors are the type of ads and the pricing of your ads that appear on your videos. You need a lot of views to begin earning money from Google Adsense.\n\nDepending on the country that you're living in you may only receive 1 or 2 dollars per 1000 views.

When I paid to promote my page I gained 80,000 followers in developing countries who didn't care about Veritasium (but I wasn't aware of this at the time). They drove my reach and engagement numbers down, basically rendering the page useless. I am not the only one who has experienced this. Rory Cellan-Jones had the same luck with Virtual Bagel: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18819338\n\nThe US Department of State spent $630,000 to acquire 2 million page likes and then realized only 2% were engaged. http://wapo.st/1glcyZo\n\nI thought I would demonstrate that the same thing is still happening now by creating Virtual Cat (http://www.facebook.com/MyVirtualCat). I was surprised to discover something worse - false likes are coming from everywhere, including Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia. So even those carefully targeting their campaigns are likely being duped into spending real money on fake followers. Then when they try to reach their followers they have to pay again.\n\nAnd it's possible to be a victim of fake likes without even advertising. Pages that end up on Facebook's \"International Suggested Pages\" are also easy targets for click-farms seeking to diversify their likes. http://tnw.co/NsflrC\n\nThanks to Henry, Grey, and Nessy for feedback on earlier drafts of this video.", "Watch how & why blogging is 10 times much better than Youtube channel for earning or making money", "A simple way to reduce you Google AdWords cost is by improving your click through rate.\nSubscribe here to learn more of my secret SEO tips: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=neilvkpatel\nFind me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/neilkpatel/\nRead more on my blog: https://neilpatel.com/blog/\n\nThe way Google AdWords works is that if you ad gets 10 times more clicks than your competitor, even if you are paying less, they are more likely to show your ad at the top because in total Google will make more money from you.\n\nSo if you want to improve your CTR you need to:\n\n1. Use SEMrush - put in keywords and competitors in SEMrush. This will show you the ad text your competitors are using. \n\nIf your competitors are constantly using a specific ad text, it usually means it converts well for them.\n\n2. Create better copy than your competitors - look at what they use and try to come up with better variations.\n\n3. Use keywords within your copy - if you include the keyword people are searching for in your ad copy you are more likely to get clicks. \n\nThe copy needs to sound good, just adding a keyword isn't enough.\n\n4. Start day parting - if you are in the B2B space people are more likely to become customers during normal business hours. So only show your ads when your ideal customers are online.\n\nFor the B2C space, you can consider running your ads during all hours of the day.\n\n5. Geo target - if you are only doing business in a certain region, then show ads only within those regions. This will help increase your overall CTR, which will reduce your ad costs.", "Hello friends, in this video I have tried to explain how much you can earn through youtube videos for every 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 and 1 million views and how you can make money through youtube.\n\nSubscribe to My Channel and Get More Great Tips:\nhttps://goo.gl/lJ8e17\n\nEveryday there are thousands visiting youtube to check on easy money and find out ways of making money on youtube. Everyone wants to know how to earn money through youtube because it youtube pays good amount of money to the youtube channels for every view that happens on the channel. \nThere are so many questions around like how do youtubers make money and how much youtube pay per views and similar to it. In this video I have explained how it actually works. \n\nIn youtube there are 4 types of ads that are displayed.\nDisplay Ads: This type of ads are visible on desktop view only. This is the kind of ad that gives maximum money to youtubers because they are based on CPC, CPM etc. You can make anything between 10 to 15 dollars for every 1,000 views in India and in if the ads are clicked from countries like America, United Kingdom, Australia then you are going to make almost 4 times of it. Image how much you can earn with million views.  \n\nOverlay Ads: This sort of ads are the ones which comes as small pop up while you are watching a video probably during the start of the video or sometime in between the video. They are low paid ads and you do not make much money out of it. It normally gives about $0.6 to 1 if you are in India and if your video is watched in US then it may go up to $3-5 which is good. This is called easy money, right? Well yes, it is. Youtube money per view is very much depended on the location where the video is watched. If your video or a clip is watched outside India in countries like US, UK, AUS etc then you have very high chances of making good money on youtube. \n\nSponsored ads: This kind of ads are basically shown on the right side of the video pane and they are also paid well as compared to overlay ads. To eanr money with youtube, you must select all sort of ads while monetizing the videos at the time of upload. How much youtubers earn would very much depend on sponsored ads because the sponsors pay hefty money for each ad displayed on your video. \n\nSkippable Ads: This kind of ads the most irritating ones for few because it doesn\u2019t allow the viewer to skip until 5 seconds. But it pays you well and so well that your youtube payment will be soaring to new heights. You will be highly delighted to see your payout from youtube for such kind of ads. That\u2019s why it is one of my favorite as well. \n\nSo now the bottom line is how much we can normally make for every 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, million views. The answer is shown in the video guys. Just have a look once and you will be highly motivated to have your own channel one day and make the most out of it. The fact is if you have more youtube subscribers then you will make more money. Simple as that. So also, focus on getting more subscribers through organic way and not by foul play. \n\nRemember guys, if adsense gets to know anything suspicious, they will just block your account and to reinstate, you have to write mails after mails and it may never get back on.  So please be calm and have patience because your videos will grow someday. \n\nWell guys. Thank you so much for watching this video. Hope you liked it.

It contains over 8,000+ suppliers including dropshippers, wholesalers, manufacturers and liquidators. \n\nQuestion #2 in our SaleHoo review: Is SaleHoo the right supplier directory for me? \n\nAnswer: We recommend SaleHoo specifically if you are looking for USA-based dropshippers. That is because there is no free directory comparable to Alibaba, the supplier directory you should use if you want to find Chinese suppliers. \n\nWe don\u2019t recommend SaleHoo if you are looking for suppliers based in other countries (such as the UK) simply because very few dropshippers exist in countries outside of USA & China, as those two countries by far manufacture the most goods. \n\nQuestion #3 in our SaleHoo review: Are all of the suppliers going to be profitable?\nAnswer: No, not all suppliers are priced low enough to make money on Amazon with dropshipping, and not all of the items in a suppliers catalog are going to be low-cost, high-profit. You\u2019ll still need to go through and identify those items yourself.\n\nQuestion #4 in our SaleHoo review: Which is better, SaleHoo vs. Worldwide Brands?\nAnswer: We strongly recommend SaleHoo over Worldwide Brands as it is cheaper and has more dropshippers/suppliers. \n\nQuestion #5 in our SaleHoo review: What about the extras (such as the market research lab)? \n\nAnswer: We personally don\u2019t care about extras like the market research lab, the SaleHoo forums and bonus ebooks. We care only about the quality of the suppliers. And we believe that the quality is great.\n\nTo prove that, follow our simple 3-step tutorial for finding items priced so low you can resell them on Amazon for a profit.\n\nStep #1 for making money dropshipping on Amazon with SaleHoo: Filter SaleHoo\u2019s suppliers to only show USA-based dropshippers \n\nSign into your account, and open the SaleHoo supplier directory. All of the suppliers have been categorized by the types of items that they sell. Start by selecting a category. It doesn\u2019t matter which category, as ideally you will go through all of the categories eventually. To start, I recommend selecting a category that interests you. \n\nOnce you open the category, on the left side of the screen you\u2019ll see search filters. Start by selecting the drop down menu under \u201cSupplier Type.\u201d From here, click \u201cDropshippers.\u201d SaleHoo will now filter the results to only show dropshippers. \n\nNext, click the drop down menu under \u201cSupplier Location.\u201d From here, click \u201cNorth America.\u201d Now SaleHoo will filter its results to only show dropshippers that are based in North America. \n\nStep #2 for making money dropshipping on Amazon with SaleHoo: Look for profitable items in a supplier\u2019s catalog \n\nFor this step, you will open up each supplier you found in step #1 and find their catalog of items that they are selling. Sometimes these may be listed on their website, sometimes you may need to open an account with them, and sometimes you may need to request a copy of their catalog. \n\nWhen you do open their catalog, look at each item, and then do a search for similar items on Amazon.com. Look for the closest lowest cost counterpart. Compare the prices of the item from the supplier to it\u2019s lowest cost counterpart on Amazon. \n\nIf the supplier has an item priced lower, we recommend using Jungle Scout to confirm if the item is making at least 1 sale a month. If it is, make a note of it. Keep going through the catalog until you\u2019ve gone through all of the items and you have a list of potential ones - we will then go through these next in step 3. \n\nStep #3 for making money dropshipping on Amazon with SaleHoo: Work out your profit margins\n\nWe now need to work out our profit margins after Amazon.com\u2019s fees. To do that, use this calculator: http://wholesaleted.com/go/amazon-calculator \n\nKeep in mind that if you have a Amazon pro merchant account, then you will have lower fees. You can get a free 30-day trial for an Amazon pro merchant subscription. \n\nIf you found this this 2017 SaleHoo review helpful, we\u2019d appreciate it if you gave it a thumbs up and subscribed to our channel for more videos like this!", "Downloading Link, \n\n\nPaytm Golden Gate eKYC App Link:-    https://goo.gl/Zw07FU\n\n Paytm Golden Gate Offline Form:-     https://goo.gl/a30KkX\n\nPaytm Golden Gate Agent List :-           https://goo.gl/ojJDyL\n\n\n\n*Enjoy exclusive offers when you upgrade your Paytm Wallet\n\nPaytm wallet is the gateway to exclusive offers designed for you and is packed with a bunch of path breaking features!

But I don't just explain it like everyone else does, I give 50 effective business ideas and websites, and explain some of the pros and cons of each of the strategies.\n\nThe first strategy is to start writing. Writing a blog is the simplest way to make money online and it doesn't take too much skill. You simply put up a Wordpress website, and start writing blog posts. You can make money from those blog posts by publishing ads on them, selling affiliate products, or selling products that you create.\n\nThe great thing about making money from a blog is that it allows you to package that information, and put it together into a Kindle book or a paperback book. Now you can make money online by selling books that you put together out of your blog posts.\n\nAnother way to make money online is to sell services as a freelancer. You can post your services on sites like Fiverr, Odesk or Elance. The kinds of services you can sell are video creation and editing services, coaching, voice overs, promotion of others, and much more. Personally, I make money on freelance websites by selling digital products as well as my business coaching.\n\nAnother way to make money online is to focus on growing your email list. Once you have someone's email address, you can send them promotional messages about anything else you will be selling in the future.\n\nIf you are able to create videos, I explain how to make money online with video in 4 ways. The first technique is through YouTube, and the other strategies have to do with creating online courses and informational products on sites like Udemy, Skillfeed and EduPow. You can also create your own membership site and sell your course through that.\n\nAdditionally, there is a great way to make money online, and that is with niche authority websites. Those are websites that focus on a small niche that they can dominate, and then sell products.\n\nHere are a few specific tutorials for making money online.\nHere is a tutorial with 25 strategies for how to make money on Udemy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wV_t9y-0FU\n\nHere is a tutorial with 10 strategies for how to make money on Fiverr.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOU8Z44lPVA", "Era galera se gotou deixa o like #mundoandroidmito link do app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prohiro.macro", "See more at http://a1websitepro.com/2014/01/11/best-ways-to-make-money-online/\n\n#dfp  #doubleclickforpublishers  #advertising  #marketing  #webdevelopment  #website \n\nDouble Click for Publishers is a large learning curve. Here is a great tutorial on how it is done! If you would like to see the website that this was implemented on go to http://maximusmccullough.com", "What is CLICK FARM? What does CLICK FARM mean? CLICK FARM meaning - CLICK FARM definition - CLICK FARM explanation.\n\nSource: Wikipedia.org article, adapted under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ license.\n\nA click farm is a form of click fraud, where a large group of low-paid workers are hired to click on paid advertising links for the click fraudster (click farm master or click farmer). The workers click the links, surf the target website for a period of time, and possibly sign up for newsletters prior to clicking another link. For many of these workers, clicking on enough ads per day may increase their revenue substantially and may also be an alternative to other types of work. It is extremely difficult for an automated filter to detect this simulated traffic as fake because the visitor behavior appears exactly the same as that of an actual legitimate visitor.\n\nFake likes generating from click farms are essentially different from those arising from computer bots where computer programs are written by software experts. To deal with such issues, companies such as Facebook are trying to create algorithms that seek to wipe out accounts with unusual activities (e.g. liking too many pages at one go).\n\nClick farms are usually located in developing countries, such as India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh. Click farms extends to likes and followers on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and more. Workers are paid on an average, one US dollar for a thousand likes or follow a thousand people on Twitter. On the other hand, click farms sell their likes and followers at a much higher price. According to the Daily Mail, \"BuyPlusFollowers sells 250 Google+ shares for $12.95. InstagramEngine sells 1,000  followers for $12. AuthenticHits sells 1,000 SoundCloud plays for $9.\"\n\nThere are two methods to click farming. The first is by hiring competitor fraudsters to deplete the advertising budget of the competitor so that they will be able to have their ads shown in higher pay-per-click rankings at a lower cost. In this case, the competitor is weakened instead of being outbid in the pay-per-click bidding system. The investment on the click farm made by the fraudster is only a very small fraction of the amount lost by the competitor. The second is by hiring the click farm workers to click on ads on the click farmer's own site. This way, the money lost by the advertisers is gained by the click farmer, rather than by the search engines and content networks as in the first method.\n\nThe need for click farming arises because, as The Guardian states, \"31% will check ratings and reviews, including likes and Twitter followers, before they choose to buy something.\" This shows the increasing importance that businesses, celebrities and other organisations put on the number of likes and followers they have. This creates monetary values for likes and followers which means that businesses and celebrities feel compelled to increase their likes to create a positive online profile.\n\nPay-per-click providers, including Google, Yahoo!, and MSN, have made substantial efforts to combat click fraud. Automated filters remove most click fraud attempts at the source. According to Deanna Yick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-based Google, she said that \u201cWe design our systems to catch bot-related attacks.\u201d \u201cBecause a significant amount of malicious traffic is automated, advertisers are protected from these kinds of attacks.\u201d she added. In an effort to circumvent these filtering systems, click fraudsters have begun to use these click farms to mimic actual visitors.\n\nEngagement rate, a performance metric that measures the quality of social media activity such as Facebook likes or Twitter retweets, can be interpreted in terms of \"engagement per follower,\" measured by dividing the raw counts of social media activity by the number of followers. Users who engage in short term click farms services will see their engagement rate plummet in time as the initial increase in the volume of social media activity drops when the click farms services end, coupled with the increase in fake followers if not the same.", "Download Link: (Wait for page to load, click green \"download\" button) http://en.savefrom.net/#url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=7LYRUOd_QoM&utm_source=youtube.com&utm_medium=short_domains&utm_campaign=www.ssyoutube.com\n\n-FACT CHECKER SHEET WITH SOURCES:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1psPUpnycllEOLCxPnWWgzqd-FVvFas3F-i5UPO6uZq8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nClinton Cash, is a feature documentary based on the Peter Schweizer book that the New York Times hailed as \u201cThe most anticipated and feared book of a presidential cycle.\u201d\n\nClinton Cash investigates how Bill and Hillary Clinton went from being \u201cdead broke\u201d after leaving the White House to amassing a net worth of over $150 million, with over $2 billion in donations to their foundation.

But do you really have to download them all and then re- upload them back to Facebook??\n\n\"Balki- don't be ridiculous!\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwK6DtGJAH0\n\nOf course not. I'm going to show you a video marketing super hack for getting all your YouTube videos over to Facebook faster because that's what I do - I'm Owen Video \n\nbumper\n\nWelcome back to thevideospot.net where everyday feels like it's christmas (subscribe in lower corner)\n\nI'm Owen Video and today I'm gonna show you how to transfer all of your YouTube videos over to Facebook where you can \n\n(Playlist thumbnail) add them to playlists\n\n(remarketing thumbnail) segment your viewers into remarketing lists\n\n(How to gen leads facebook live Thumb) and run ads that make you millions of dollars.\n\n(add icard there)\n\nUploading directly to Facebook is a BEAR bc you can only upload one video per browser window and it takes forever. With this tactic you'll save a ton of time PLUS YouTube will transfer all the data including the thumbnail which means you pretty much have an optimized video waiting for you on Facebook\n\nSo let's get started by going to my video manager on YouTube. \n\n(Screencast)\nWhat we're going to do first is install a plugin called Tubebuddy and you can get that by clicking on the link below. \n\nOnce installed, you'll see that I've got this Tubebuddy icon in various parts of the page. \n\nArrow - When I click the main icon at the top you can see your new dashboard with healthy reports, keyword research tools, a thumbnail generator, and more. \n\nRed Arrow - But for now we're going to select the BULK option here and click Publish to Facebook. \n\n(me pop up on screen!) As a note - You can transfer as many videos as you like BUT the Facebook interface is not so easy to work with. Consider moving in certain videos at a time so you can organize them on Facebook.\n\n...\n\nWith this option here I'm able to add videos thematically. For example, by transferring over all my Web Design first, I'm able to quickly organize them into a playlist on Facebook. \n\nJust type in your search term and click next. On this page, I can select from public and unlisted videos, determine their upload order, and select the videos I want to publish. \n\nClick next and the processing begins. Once completed, this window will show you your successful transfers and be on the lookout for alerts from Facebook that say your video is ready to be viewed. \n\n(Back to me) Publishing will take as long as how many videos you have but I've transferred up to 20 at a time and it took less than an hour. Just keep your computer connected to the internet and go get a mocha chino... by the time you come back your uploads will probably be done. \n\nSplit Screen\nLogo and text - Get it now. Link is below. \nNow Tubebuddy is a premium tool they did not pay me to make this video but they are great friends and I use their tool in almost every element of my process I recommend Tubebuddy to all my clients. \n\nSplit Screen \nVideo of one of my Facebook Lives\nJoin me in my private Facebook group for fans of the channel - I go live once a week with a small training or Q&A. Video has helped me create an awesome lifestyle and I can show you how to do the same.

Not surprised he and Franklin were cheating the stock market. Gangsters? More like Banksters...\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n\n1. progress the story to at least after Lifeinvader mission* and open LCN stocks\n2. sort by % change\n3. invest in worst negative % return (should be Lifeinvader but sometimes it works on other stocks)\n4. instantly** sell (ignore the % return, even if it says you lost money, made money, or still says 0, it's wrong)\n5. ????\n6. profit\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nThis glitch only works in the original versions of GTA5 on current-gen. Rockstar FIXED (read: REMOVED) this glitch in version update 1.04 (which is 1.20 for GTAO). For this to work, you MUST be on current-gen PS4 or Xbox One (no PC) using an earlier version of the game (versions 1.01-1.03 would work but you cannot update to them anymore). So, basically, it means you need an UN-UPDATED version of GTA5 on current-gen consoles -- if you update the game, this will NOT work. \n\nThis video is not really a tutorial, either. Sorry =( This is the original live gameplay video showing when I discovered the glitch. It was the very 1st time I re-produced it. If you check the upload date, you can see it's 2 days after the game released; then, Rockstar patched the glitch 6 days later. But if you install (and don't update) the original GTA 5 current-gen version of the game, this glitch will FOREVER work and will always ALWAYS WORK.\n\nIt's 100% guaranteed to work and repeatable IF you're using the original current-gen console version of the game. If it's NOT working for you, please try:\n\nTHINGS TO TRY IF IT DOES NOT WORK:\n\n-make sure you're on PS4 or Xbox One\n-make sure your patch version is 1.05 or older (Rockstar fixed/removed this bug a few months after GTA V current-gen released)\n-make sure you're using Lifeinvader after it has crashed\n-- try progress the story past Fame or Shame so that Lifeinvader is 'crashed' but also now 'randomly recovering/fluctuating'\n--- the glitch doesn't always work if a stock is 'stuck crashing' ... it needs to be crashed to a very low negative return of probably over -70% but still be able to change (e.g. when you reload a save over and over and over, each time Lifeinvader will be a different 'crashed' value)\n\n*this video and all my attempts are done after Dead Man Walking but I've heard that it works earlier right after Heist 1 (on Trevor) or immediately after the Lifeinvader mission soon as the stock crashes. But if the glitch is NOT working for you, try to progress the mission story farther.\n**switching characters may help but isn't always required. \n\nABOUT THE VIDEO:\n\nI apologize that the video is overly long and confusing. This was not expected to be a tutorial video and I did not expect anyone other than a few people at GTAForums or NeoGAF to see it.\n\nThe video is the 1st time I re-produced the glitch. I actually noticed on day 1 crashed stocks seemed buggy but I didn't understand it yet. I kept experimenting casually after the 1st Heist, and then I discovered it. If you check the upload date of the video, it's barely even 2 days after the game released. It's the 1st video on Youtube showing the glitch. \n \nThis video is the very first time I re-produced it. So, I quickly PS Shared it with some friends on a couple message boards. I didn't expect more than a few friends to see it.\n\nSo, I apologize if it's unclear and I'm sorry if it's confusing or useless enough to anyone that they feel the need to Dislike the video. I didn't upload it to waste peoples time. My intention was just, 'Hey, I think I just found a stock market glitch, pretty sure I can reproduce it... check it out.\" Since then obviously the glitch was understood a bit better. \n\nAlso, there are a few newer videos made by other people and those are really helpful tutorials. I think one of the other top search results is very clear and better presented, so if my video is too confusing, I recommend some of the others. \n\nMine isn't really the same thing because this video isn't a tutorial -- it's almost like raw footage of the first time that the glitch was reproduced and uploaded to Youtube.\n\nThanks for all the views and I'm always happy to try help with the glitch if you have any questions.

He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Universal (1993)\nCast: Ezra Dagan, Ralph Fiennes\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\nProducers: Irving Glovin, Kathleen Kennedy, Branko Lustig, Gerald R.

Don\u2019t Buy into this Scam: ClickBank Affiliate Marketing Review Scam. Take Surveys for Cash Crap. Watch the video on what I bought and what happened afterword\u2019s, the worst boiler room pressure scare tactics I\u2019ve ever seen. In fact, I\u2019m going to check my credit rating today to ensure fake credit cards are not being made in my name by scam artists. PLEASE SHARE so others don\u2019t become prey.\n\nI have been studying Affiliate Marketing for months to find products that will help people become entrepreneurs and in turn hoping to sell good quality products. My journey has been anything but enjoyable, after downloading over 100 free reports, watching countless webinars and videos and buying and returning multiple products I have now given up at least in the ClickBank, JV Zoo and similar areas. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the ads on Face Book all about making huge amounts of money almost instantly. Affiliate marketing is rife with dishonesty and crappy products. From claiming to cure diabetes, tinnitus you name it, all unproved, yet Click Bank racks them in by the thousands. \n\nI have never seen so much bullshit in my entire life, people claiming to make millions in many cases in less than one year. One company said they made 8 million in 3 months. When you look at advertising laws in both the US and Canada it\u2019s clear they are all in violation, why are they getting away with this? Any claims of earnings are to be backed up by legitimate sources and NONE of them have it. \n\nI have asked multiple affiliate marketing advertisers to please give examples of good quality Click Bank products or Amazon stores they own but they all say the same thing, \u201cthat\u2019s not the way it works\u201d. WTF, if I knew they had a good quality product I\u2019d buy it. A decent amount of my income comes from plastic surgeons, is that going to put me out of business, of course not. This is all because they all sell training only, yet according to Click Bank that category is nowhere near the top sellers. Then why the hell do they do it? And why if someone is making that kind of money would they offer training instead of making the money from the products they advocate? Pretty sure most know the real answer and that is THEY MAKE MORE MONEY.\n\nAnd the worst part is they prey on newbies, get them loaded up in debt based on false dreams to make money quick only to enrich their own bank accounts. \n\nI think it\u2019s time the Media and Law Enforcement start digging into this industry, without question newbies are losing out millions and millions of dollars with a less than 1% chance of making any real money. \n\nThat\u2019s not all, Face Book is allowing these deceiving ads that would never be approved by the Competition Bureau, I smell a very large scam and the only ones making money are the scammers and Face Book. \n\nPS: I\u2019ve been in the digital marketing business since 2000, I\u2019m NOT trying to sell you anything, I just felt it\u2019s time people became educated so you don\u2019t lose your hard earned money and worse borrow to get into this incredibly deceptive industry.", "this is the link to the site \n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/32hb8u8\n\nthis video helps you to earn money by sharing pictures online\ntags-\nsharing pictures,picture sharing,earn money,photo sharing site,making money,computer tricks,money making tricks,get rich,million,rupee.currency,share images,image sharing,image sharing and earning,tricks,online money,money without investment,100% real money,genuine money making site,", "Suspicious emails: unclaimed insurance bonds, diamond-encrusted safe deposit boxes, close friends marooned in a foreign country.

In this video I show you how to register a domain name then make a website on it using the same software as Fortune 500 companies and celebrities. Don't worry, no techy experience required, it's all 100% beginner friendly.\n\nIf you have a GoDaddy domain and want to make a website on it, this is the perfect video for you. Learn how to save money on a godaddy website by making a WordPress website and using a web host (HostGator) which is actually cheaper in the long run. Of course we will learn plenty of WordPress skills from scratch too.\n\n60% Hosting Discount Link: http://www.dearblogger.org/discount/\n\nSee the WordPress website we make https://goo.gl/UTYwZp - Imagine all of your content in there instead and keep in mind when you start a website at godaddy you can create any website you want later on.\n \nThe Core Steps:\n\n1. Register Domain - 2:14\n2. Get Web Hosting - 15:15\n2.1 Connect It All - 27:48\n3. Install WordPress - 32:50\n\nWhat is WordPress? WordPress is the #1 CMS (Content Management System). A CMS allows you to change how your site looks and organize your content (text, images, videos, etc) without having to look at code. Instead it looks like Microsoft Word but on the internet.\n\nUpdate: Many Have asked so I'm adding this Price Comparison\n\nOPTION 1 (recommended, we use it here): register godaddy domain for under $10. Then, get hostgator hosting. As you'll see hostgator is much cheaper at 36 months, 12 months and 1 month with our coupon BigBonus. I use this combo of godaddy and hostgator and enjoy knowing how each one works separately. It's nice because they both specialize in each respective component and I can easily move away from one place if I want later on. \nOPTION 2: (more expensive, but you get to keep everything website related at godaddy): register godaddy domain and hosting at godaddy. The cheapest monthly hosting is $7.99/mo, or $4.99/mo for 12 months. It still works.\n\nEither way, the nuts and bolts of this create a GoDaddy website tutorial are done at 37:07 because we have a real website up, so we take a break. We then move on to design your website professionally and add your own content.

Don\u2019t worry - you can still create an USA Amazon seller account using this video tutorial :) \n\nWant to launch your own private label products and build a successful e-commerce brand? Catch our next (free) live training webinar to learn how - http://importempire.com\n\nIn this video, Will takes you through the step-by-step tutorial on how to open & set up your Amazon Seller Account (USA/North America). You'll see how easy it is to get your Amazon Seller Account up and running, so you can start selling products and making money!\n\nCreate your Amazon Seller Account here - http://startupbros.com/amazon-seller-account\n\n-Learn the step by step process to sell on Amazon and start your business: https://startupbros.com/how-to-sell-on-amazon-fba/\n\nIf you live in one of the 102 countries that Amazon supports, you can create a USA/North America Amazon Seller Account using your personal credit card, address, and phone number.\n\nIf you don't live in one of these 102 countries, you'll need a credit card, address, and phone number from a country that Amazon supports.\n\nInternational folks can use these services to obtain those required items - \n\nUSA Credit Card - http://startupbros.com/payoneer\nUSA Phone Number - http://startupbros.com/grasshopper\nUSA Address - http://startupbros.com/mailboxforwarding\n\nI Live in Australia/United Kingdom/Canada/New Zealand/France/Germany - can I still sell on Amazon.com even though I\u2019m not a USA resident?\n\nAbsolutely. Amazon.com didn\u2019t used to allow it, but in the past year or so, Amazon.com has opened up its accounts to non-USA residents. Now, people in 102 countries can sign-up. The chances are, your country is supported, and you won\u2019t even need a USA credit card/phone number/address. If your country isn\u2019t supported, then use the services we recommended above to create a USA Amazon seller account with a USA credit card/phone number/address. \n\nShould I Sell as an Individual or as a Professional Account?\n\nIf you select to sell as an individual, you won\u2019t have to pay the $39.99 monthly fee. Instead, you will have to pay a $0.99 per-transaction fee on each sale. This means then that if you sell more than 40 items a month, the Professional account is a bargain and the way to go. But until you\u2019re selling more than 40 items, I recommend selecting the Individual account to lower the cost to get started and to minimize your risk. \n\nDon\u2019t Worry About Picking the Best Business Name Just Yet\n\nOne of the first things you\u2019re going to have to do when you create a USA Amazon seller account is choose a business name. Don\u2019t stress about this because if you want, you can change your name later if it is still available.\n\nCan I Immediately Start Selling Once I\u2019ve Created my Account?\n\nYes, you can! One of the wonderful things about Amazon.com is the moment you\u2019ve set up your account, you can start to sell ASAP. You don\u2019t even need to verify your account to post your first listing. There is nothing holding you back: So get started ASAP.\n\nNow that you know how to create a USA Amazon seller account, you need to find profitable items to sell in it.

He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Universal (1993)\nCast: Ralph Fiennes, Embeth Davidtz\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\nProducers: Irving Glovin, Kathleen Kennedy, Branko Lustig, Gerald R.

If the answer is yes, it is quite likely that you have invested countless hours researching how to make money while working a flexible schedule from the comfort of your own home. While all that research may not yet have been successful in yielding the kind of life-changing income you\u2019ve been seeking, there is at least one site that provides a very real opportunity to generate thousands of dollars each and every month through a simple system that requires very little effort on your part. That site is Sevendollarclick.com, where I have been bringing in an average of $7,000 to $8,000 per month for the past two years.\n\nBefore signing up for Sevendollarclick.com, I too had spent a great deal of time seeking a new work opportunity, hoping that I could find out how to make money online without having to accept any reduction in my income. While performing search after search on how to make money, I began looking into pay-to-click websites, or PTCs, as I believed that this was the best option for someone looking for a way to bring in consistently exceptional income without having to make a massive commitment of time and energy.\n\nHaving previously worked in marketing, I was quite well aware of how much revenue online advertising was capable of generating and how valuable the views and clicks of those advertisements could be, so I spent quite a bit of time looking into all of the details I could find about the PTCs I had discovered with the goal of analyzing the potential income possible through each one. After a detailed analysis of each site, I selected Sevendollarclick.com, which I felt offered the greatest opportunity for generating substantial monthly earnings while requiring a relatively minimal investment of time on my part. At a rate of $7 per click, it is not all that difficult to understand how to make money quickly and easily through the intuitive PTC system made available through Sevendollarclick.com.\n\nIn this video, I detail my personal experience with Sevendollarclick.com and delineate the simple strategies I have used over the last two years to take home over $7,000 in income on a monthly basis. This includes instructions regarding how to sign up for the website and how to make money online just by clicking the advertisements Sevendollarclick.com makes accessible through its website. The membership guidelines and payout options are also discussed in detail, and I have included an overview of the company\u2019s consistency in making payments available to its members in a timely fashion along with any other relevant information you might be interested in learning while researching how to make money online.\n\nMy experience with Sevendollarclick.com could not have been any smoother. Just over two years ago, I found this PTC website and took the few moments necessary to sign up and log in before being able to access the advertisements. Once I was logged in, I started clicking advertisements immediately and kept at it until I had met the $7,000-threshold for payment. Having purchased a membership shortly after signing up for the site, the withdraw button was already visible to me and payout was available following the agreed-upon 75-day waiting period.\n\nDuring that initial 75-day window, I continued to click on the ads made accessible to me through Sevendollarclick.com and have since enjoyed a steady income of at least $7,000 per month, which has always been credited to my account on time. All you need to do to have a similar experience to mine is to follow the simple guidelines outlined by Sevendollarclick.com and to invest a relatively minimal amount of time and effort to consistently click on the ads, after which you can just sit back and enjoy all of the possibilities suddenly available to you when you are compensated at a rate of $7 per click.", "Click Here to Signup: https://goo.gl/sLaJ2a\nRecently Payment Proof: http://prntscr.com/h30tp4\n\nPaidverts is one of the top and best PTC site nowadays in terms of earning.

If your article becomes one of the ten highest traffic-pullers of the month, you'll earn an additional bonus payment of $100.\n\nWhen will I actually get the money?\n\nUsually three to 10 days after submission. You don't have to wait until the article is published -- you turn it in, we show you how to fill out the invoice, it gets processed. Ask anybody -- we're good about paying quickly.\n\nHow do I get my money?\n\nYou will need a PayPal account in order to get paid, and the first time you're published, you'll need to fill out a simple online tax form. It's pretty easy. Once you fill out those forms for the first time, you shouldn't ever have to do it again.\n\nI don't have any experience in writing. Can I still do this?\n\nAbsolutely. You don't need to have experience or a degree. You just have to have ideas. Moderators and editors will help you through the process. Many of our highest-traffic articles were written by people who had never before published a single word. Some of them were still in high school.\n\nIs all of this a scam? Are you just harvesting contact info for spam or identity theft reasons?\n\nIf so, we're apparently playing a very long con -- we've been publishing public submissions for about a decade now (since mid 2007) and we are owned by E.W. Scripps, a media company that has been in business since 1878. We have very high standards for what we publish, and that's always been the key to our success. If it's good, your work will be seen by a few hundred thousand to a couple million people.\n\nSign up to Cracked \u27a1\ufe0f http://www.cracked.com/write-for-cracked/\n\nHow do I submit an article?\n\nYou'll just be showing us your idea at first. If it's accepted, we'll have you write up the full article later. To submit a pitch, click this link http://forums.cracked.com/viewforum.php?f=20&sid=8378d7b90fafc71f4fc40d510c947a86 , which takes you to the Cracked Comedy Workshop (again, it won't be visible unless you do the steps above first). You'll see a whole bunch of threads full of advice and archives of accepted articles. You can read around in there all you like, but for now, scroll down until you see the \"New Topic\" button:\n\nClick that, and pitch your idea. A moderator will then come into the thread you created and give you more instructions, showing you how the pitch process works.\n\n- John\n\nConnect with me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nLike our Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nJoin Our Private Group To get help: https://www.facebook.com/groups/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/johnmichaelmarketing/\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/johnmichaeljmm\nAdd us on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/johnminspires\n\nEarnings Disclaimer:\u00a0\nhttps://www.johnmichaelmarketing.com/earnings-disclaimer/\n\nShare this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl304ERRdi8\nRecommended video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSxc_aZlLp4\n\nSOURCE: http://www.cracked.com/blog/how-to-make-money-doing-stuff-cracked-no-bs-guide/\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad------------------------------------------------------\nSTEP 1.

Lesser known these methods may be but they are definitely not less profitable.\n\nPPC or Pay Per Click is exactly what it sounds like. You put an ad on your site. If someone clicks on the ad you get paid.\nThe Pay Per Click market is dominated by Google Adsense. Adsense serves up ads that are relevant to a page\u2019s content and to a visitors browsing history.\n\n- Adsense works well with large amounts of untargeted traffic. Like say on a news site.\n- You can expect to make 10 cents to $2 per click, depending on your niche.\n- Many websites use Adsense because it\u2019s so easy. As long as you have traffic Adsense will make money.\n\nDon't lose money make sure to convert your website's traffic into money by implementing these monetization methods.", "if u wanna make money online register here and i'll support you https://www.neobux.com/?r=wannaaadell", "The best free & cheap URL Shortener and Link Tracking software for my CPA and Affiliate Marketers which is better than bit.ly, click magic and voluum for absolute beginners.\n\nSign up Now:\ud83d\udc49 https://www.bonaetly.com/JoinNow \ud83d\udc48\n\nMake $100 per day from Google AdSense on complete Autopilot 2018 Tricks Revealed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUQrI2TvYMU&t=5s\n\nMake $5000 per month with CPA Marketing 2018\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LmggRTT0_4\n\nJoin Our Biggest Digital Marketplace Forums: http://bit.ly/BonaetForums\n\nJoin our Bonaet Forums to get more Premium Stuffs for FREE.\n\nMake $5000 per month by CPA Marketing Blueprint 2018\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LmggRTT0_4\n\nHello guys this is me Techy Bonaet back with my new video to help you guys to make money online with Whaff Rewards application.\n\nMake money from Bitcoin $100 a day.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvkM9hTdDVY\n\nWatch my CPAGRIP Part 1 video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn6ckPOeT9A\n\nWacth my CPAGRIP part 2 video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54sxIXg_oas&t=516s\n\nWacth my CPAGRIP part 3 video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HkofZ40Fg8\n\nPlease Do Subscribe to my YouTube channel and Hit the bell icon to get notifications from my channel.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEi0wXp3RwXxdowvHNZYhA\n\nIf you guys have any problem do follow or message me on my social networks.\n\nFollow me on:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/techy.bonaet\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/techybonaet\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/techybonaet/\n\nGmail: techy.bonaet007@gmail.com\n\nLike my Page: https://www.facebook.com/bonaet/\n\nThank You!

After being promoted the youngest Vice President in the trading division of Barclays Bank headquarters in London UK, he realized there was more to life than working for \"the man\". \n\nHe went on to build, scale and sell five separate, six-figure a year digital publishing and education businesses. He then merged his passion for finance and for the internet by co-founding 8020Research.com - the No 1 publishing house dedicated to helping people live the life they dream, desire and deserve by leveraging the Internet. \n\nThe income generated from these online businesses allowed him to buy and sell five properties in the UK, drive some of the nicest cars, and get on some of the most incredible adventures in the world such as the TransSiberian Railway, drinking vodka with the country\u2019s top trader and his family on 3 separate trips to Mongolia, drinking Steins of beer in Oktoberfest, Germany with the locals for 3 years in a row, partying with (mostly) Australians at the Run of the Bulls (Spain) on 3 separate years, and the list could go on. \n\n\"Formal education will make you a living, self education will make you a fortune\" \n\nAfter investing $150,000 into his own trading education and self-improvement, he became financially free by the age of 35 and is now on a mission to help 100,000 average people take back control of growing and protecting their wealth by December 31st, 2020 as the government, employers or the system certainly won't. \n\n\"Pay for mentors or pay for mistakes, your choice\" \n\nYoutube: http://8020research.com/yt \n\nKick-ass Facebook Community: http://8020research.com/fbgroup \n\nTop 3 Cryptos to Buy Today: http://8020research.com/top3-facebook https://twitter.com/8020tiz \n\nWeb: http://8020research.com", "Littlebux Make Money Online by Clicking", "Guys, this is another online money earning video.

According to a recent post in 'Small Business Trends' there are over 6.6 million plus home-based businesses that can make money from home. All these businesses require funding and increase website traffic, of some sort. Unless you can learn the business and get your startup capital from referrals revenue. Everything depends on the nature of the business.\n\nIn most cases you will need ways to make extra money.  Making money on the internet, will depend on the nature of the program. You often hear that it takes money to make money. It is better of course to start small in any case and expand your business as your profits grow. While you are starting a home-based business it's better to continue with your existing full or part time job and learn the art of patience before making any career decisions.\n\nBanks are a popular way to get funding. Although they have associated costs and risks, some use their existing contacts and rely on learning the business well enough to show and prove its success. The more homework you do on your business the more you reduce the risks to earn online.\n\nA proven home-based business called Profit Clicking is proving itself to be a very safe low risk venture to get paid online. Paying since 2010 and provides cutting edge products and services, Profit clicking is becoming one of the hottest businesses to partner with.

Advertisers buy clicks to their websites and program members earn a share of the revenue when they visit these websites. There is also a referral system in place so members can build downlines and earn from them.The Neobux program is one of many of these types of programs on the internet today. This is the very simple method to earn money by just click on ad's.You click on links, visit advertiser websites, stay on them for a certain period of time, and you earn money for it.\nHow to earn money by click on ad's on Neobux\nDon't rent any refs until you have earned 3 dollars (if you want things to go faster you can, of course invest some money). Transfer your 3 dollars from your \"Main Balance\" to your \"Rental Balance\". You now have 1 dollar per ref and you won't have any problems with recycling the inactive ones and/or with extending your refrells.This is where you enable \"AutoPay\"\nWhen you have purchased your first 3 refs, you should enable \"AutoPay\", which is a very good tool. Referrals cost 30 cent to extend for one month.if a ref view 4 ads you will get paid for 3 of them and get to keep the ref for another day.There are many different ideas and methods of how to best use the recycle tool. A good strategy in the beginning is to recycle any ref that hasn't clicked on any ads today.\n\nFor more videos subscribe to my channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2WS4YwutJuyyiiZ2ds9FQ\n\nI created this video with the YouTube Video Editor (http://www.youtube.com/editor)", "125 $ losted by self Clicks.... !!!!\nhow to earn by self clicking in AdSense right way is here watch now.!!!\nis vpn use is good for self clicking ?? \nall you will find your answers here \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\n\n\nhope you all liked it !!! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL LINKS  FOR CHANNEL UPDATES-\n\n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/imshivamsaluja\n\nFOLLOW OUR FACEBOOK PAGE-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ShivamIsTriggered\n\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER-\nhttps://www.twitter.com/imshivamsaluja\n\nThank-you\nSubscribe :)\n\nIntro - https://www.velosofy.com\n\nTHAT'S IT FOR TODAY !!!!\n\nTHANK YOU AND KEEP SUPPORTING :)", "How to make advertisement, look advertisement, extend referral, transfer Account balance to Purchase balance earn easy money : \nLink for REGISTER: http://www.family-clicking.com/?ref=spax23", "CLICK IT!!!: http://www.linkbucks.com/referral/108758", "Website Link - https://goo.gl/3B9Nqp \nHow to create Paypal -https://goo.gl/odzDgZ", "My Leader max's out in my advertising pays join me here http://bit.ly/aayoutubex", "Link:  http://www.probux.com/?rh=4962726168696D33373039 \n\n\nProbux is a PTC site, where you can earn money by clicking ads, doing offers and tasks, getting direct referrlas or renting referrals.Renting referrals is a system where you can get one referral user from probux for 30 days if you pay $0.20; so if they click ads, you get some of their money, so if you have hundreds of rented referrals you can earn alot more money!

Visit today to get a FREE internet marketing course.\n\nPay per click advertising works the same across all platforms.  Meaning that platforms like Google, Bing, Yahoo all work under the same premise.\n\nAt its foundation, all that pay per click really is, is a auction where a number of advertisers bid against each other to show up on the top spot of a search engine in order to get you to see their website.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\nLet's say that the keyword that a number of advertisers wanted to bid on was \"Website Keyword Research Tool\".  Now, most of us know that keyword research is one of the most important things todo before ever creating a website.\n   \nFor those who don't know, keyword research is the act of trying to find the right keywords to focus on in your website in an effort to rank organically for them in search engines.  Keyword research is extremely important because if you are able to rank in the natural search results on keywords in search engines, you are able to consistently get traffic delivered to your website without paying for any marketing.\n\nSo, here is our keyword, \"website keyword research tool\".  \nAnd here are the 10 advertisers that want to compete to be shown in paid search results for \"website keyword research tool\".  In other words, all 10 of these companies have some sort of product or offering that they want individuals who are searching for a keyword research tool to see.  \n\nIn order to determine the best ad for the user, search engines look at three main factors.\n\nFirst, and not surprisingly, the search engine will look at how much money each company is willing to bid for that particular keyword.  Obviously, the higher the bid for a keyword, the more likely of a chance that the ad will be seen.\n\nSecond, the search engine looks at how relevant the keyword is to the ad being shown.  The thought here is that if an ad includes the actual search query that the user has typed in, the more likely it is that the product being advertised is what the user wants.  This makes sense because there isn't a company out there that want to create ads that are relevant to what they are trying to sell.\nThird, the search engine reviews the website landing page to ensure that the content on that page is relevant to the keyword and to the ad.  This ensures that companies don't bid on keywords and create ads are relevant and then lead the user to a page that is irrelevant to their original search query.\nWhen a user searches for this term, in fractions of a second the search engine will look at all of the advertisers competing , all three of these factors, and serve ads to the user.\n\nThe user is then shown 10 different ads with the most relevant and highest price ad on the top followed by ads below that which are paying less money or less relevant.\n\nFrom there, the user clicks, which costs the advertising website money, and then the user is brought to a landing page showcasing the product or offering that the company advertised.\nSo we are going to do now is we're going to do a screen share and I will show you exactly how this process works using Google.  I'm using Google because it accounts for roughly 70% of the search market share on the Internet and is the industry leader in serving ads for those who search for information on the Internet.\nOne thing that is important to note is that the keyword research tool that I use, which is called long tail Pro, doesn't do pay per click advertising and has relied on word-of-mouth to grow, so it isn't going to be listed in the search results.  If you want to know more about this keyword research tool, which has a free 10 day trial, then check outwww.OneHourProfessor.com/keywordtool.\nSo here we are in Google and we are going to search for \"website keyword research tool\".  Now once we do that you can see that there are numerous advertisers who are bidding on that particular keyword.\n\nAs I said before, Google has determined what ad should be shown by reviewing three main factors which are the bid, the relevancy of the ad, and the relevancy of the landing page.", "https://www.theadsteam.com/page/landing/4/Deacontony\n\n\"How To Get Paid\"  Make Money Clicking ADS No Sponsoring Required!!

Emotion Miner Review I did that In my quest for new ways to earn money online, I came across an exciting and unique website called Emotion Miner.\n\nThe name intrigued me and I decided to learn about it further.\n\nI visited their site and it said: \u201cMake money and advance science by watching TV-shows\u201d.\n\nWait, what? Must be another scam, I thought.\n\nBut I was curious enough to give it a try.\n\nRead my Emotion Miner review to find out how to make money by watching videos!\nWhat is Emotion Miner?\nIt is a platform that allows you to make money by determining what a person is experiencing. This involves tracking facial expressions, evaluating the intonation, and analyzing the poses.\n\nThe fun part is, all the above-mentioned things have to be done for different videos that we usually watch to entertain ourselves.\n\nSo, now you can get entertained and paid at the same time. Interesting, right\n\n\nConnect Me :  https://www.facebook.com/nayeminfo24\n\n\n\nThank You :)", "FREE TRAINING VIDEO: How To Make $30k/Month \u27a1\ufe0f http://LifeWithoutLimits.co\n\nClick this link to watch the free video and find out how you can start making money from your laptop.\n\n_______________________________\n\nHow To Get Paid To Click Buttons\n\nWith Emotion Miner, you must complete tasks clicking on emotions.\n\nEach task contains a random number of videos. The videos are divided into short fragments (about 5 sec).\n\nFor each fragment you have to select emotions of the interviewed person. After completing markup for all fragments of all videos in the task you can start another task.\n\nAfter money withdrawal request you work is due to a quality control check and if it is approved you get paid.\n\nWhy do we need to click buttons to decide what emotions people are feeling?\n\nAs Emotion Miner's put's it:\n\nHumans can recognize emotions. Computers can't.\n\nUnder the hood you're teaching artificial intelligence what we look like when we are happy, confused, surprised, etc.\n\nContribute to neuroscience and help Neurodata Lab get one step closer to development of a system that can recognize and interpret human emotions.\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

(Get Paid Fast & Easy PayPal Money - Best Free Sites 2017)", "Automatic blur background in 1 click : https://goo.gl/3iwsMw How to link blogger add  adsense & earn money ? || by technical naresh\n\nClick Here For More : https://goo.gl/q5MLY4 \n\nLinking your existing Google AdSense account to blogspot is very difficult because your newly created blogger blog will not get approved easily until and unless you have a successfully created a blog with many number of pages and many articles lying in it. Google AdSense becoming one of the top advertising firm in all over the world and also one of the reputed advertising platform. It is the dream of every blogger to use AdSense ads to monetize their blogs and websites.\n\nHow to Link Existing Google Adsense Account to New blogspot\n\nSuppose you created new blog in blogspot platform and you want to show Google AdSense ads in your new blogspot blog in that case you have a direct option inside the blogspot settings to monetize your blog by clicking the option earnings in your settings page of blogger. As soon as you click earnings option then you see Google AdSense page showing. In that Google AdSense page you will see an option called as sign-up for AdSense which won\u2019t allow you to click on that option because you can see that option but you can click that and next to the sign-up with Google AdSense option you\u2019ll see a message telling you that your blog doesn\u2019t qualify for Google AdSense.\n\nThis is the most common problem which is faced by all blogspot new bloggers. If your blog is fully ready with all the posts and every other thing than only you can click on this option sign up with Google AdSense at the time it will allow you to click on that. And for those who have already an existing AdSense account also to them even it won\u2019t allow you to link existing Google AdSense account to your blogspot blog.\n\nLink Existing Google Adsense Account to Blogspot\nNow I will unveil the truth. If you already have an Google AdSense account which you got from YouTube and also you run an other professional website or blog like www.sharedelete.com or www.xyz.com. If you already have a Google AdSense account link to your professional blog like www.sharedelete.com then you can easily place AdSense advertisements in your blogspot blog I will show you the trick now.\n\nI have a Google AdSense account which I got approved from YouTube and also I got approved for my own professional blog that is www.sharedelete.com now I started a new blogspot blog that is www.goazeem.blogspot.in two days before so what I did is I added my blogspot site in Google AdSense owned sites and then I also added my blogspot blog in Google Webmaster tools and Google analytics than I copied the existing created ad unit code and pasted in my blogspot blog then it started to show advertisements within seconds. See without having sufficient number of post in my blogspot blog and also without clicking on sign up for AdSense in blogspot settings I really managed to show Google AdSense advertisements in my new blog started two days ago. Now I\u2019ll tell you in detail how I did that.\n\nDont Forget to Check out These Videos\n\n1.Add money in Paytm from Bank A/C :https://youtu.be/NNkAgexeeHU\n2.Change Voter Id Name/DOB/Address/Gender Ect : https://youtu.be/gbLTAWbZlqE\n3.Apply Online Driving License in India :https://youtu.be/wmNe51RDv58\n4.Download and Install Bluestack App Player in Hindi :https://youtu.be/pZ5jm7Xms1s\n5.Transfer Money From PNB Bank Account  to Any Bank Account in Hindi :https://youtu.be/KHalRtPqfkw\n6.Check Your Phone VoLTE Support or Not For HD Jio Calling : https://youtu.be/5ubK5pbghag\n7.Link Blogger add adsense  & Earn Money ? :https://youtu.be/obVdsfJVIwU\n8.Upgrade Windows 7,8.1 To Windows 10 For Free- 2018 :https://youtu.be/EAoyUwZ9d-4\n9.Add Cash in Paytm Wallet ?  \u092a\u0947\u091f\u0940\u090f\u092e \u092c\u091f\u0941\u090f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0928\u0915\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947  \u091c\u094b\u0921\u093c\u0947\u0902 ? :https://youtu.be/aXMTcgl0Eyk\n10.Connect to Bank Account to Google Adsense Account : https://youtu.be/C-5atFAR0g4\n\n\nAbout My Channel\n\nTechnical Naresh Youtube Channel Provides daily new ideas ,Tips and tricks about Android Computer, Internet \n,Facebook,Youtube,Mobile,Google ,Twitter ,Yahoo ,Internet Security,Data Security,Discovering New Technology, \nWebsite Development ,Design And Web Hosting Services / Domain Registration and make money online Tips & Tricks \nOnline Classes.You can learn everyday something new about technology with Computer In Hindi .You can request for a \nSpecific video if you facing any problem.\n\nLike Us On Facebook :- https://goo.gl/jvpVH7\nFollow Us On Google + :- https://goo.gl/ieYQ3e\nFollow Us On Twitter : https://goo.gl/XKygD2\nVisit Our Website :- http://www.computerinhindi.in/\n\nThanks for watching and don't forget to keep smiling :\n\nNOTE : All Content used is copyright to Technical Naresh, \nUse or commercial display or editing of the content without proper \nauthorization is not allowed.", "With This Method You Can Make or Earn money by just clicking.

In order to see success with your ads and to make a high return on investment on your campaigns targeting plays a big part, for example if I was to run a campaign and I want to target people that are interested in wine, If typed in wine, it shows it has an audience of 8,900,000 and just by selecting wine it gives us an estimated reach of over 400,000 people, this is not the best practice when targeting your areas of interest. Most people on the Facebook Ad platform are doing multiple word dumps, their interests are un targeted and too generic. You want to use the Facebook search box and typing your keywords and see which fanpages come back relating to those keywords and then you can go and like those pages and use those as precise interests when using your targeting. And each fan page seems to have it own bid price, and most people I'm not doing micro niche targeting, their just typing in a word like wine and targeting everything underneath that category and this is possibly a reason why they are not receiving the highest conversions with their ads. \n\nIn order to see maximum results from your campaign the best strategy is to develop a landing page to match the keywords that you target. This way you will definitely see an increase in conversions.\n\nFacebook Golden Tactic number three: Split Test and Maximise your return. Now running any campaigns on Facebook one thing to sure is that you split-test your campaigns that means taking one campaign and splitting up into several different parts, so you could have one image and then you could duplicate the image onto another campaign and use a different title and different body text but keep on using the same image. Then you could duplicate that again use the same title and the same body text but changed image around. What happens here is you start to see which add is more effective with your audience, and therefore you can keep on scrapping out the ones that are not doing well and you can move over to the ones that are performing well and you can split them again. So make sure that you split test and find out that winning campaign.\n\nFacebook golden tactic number 4 capture the lead. \n\nI've noticed that many marketers fail to do this. They are not capturing the leads when running any of their Facebook campaigns. You should try to capture the lead of every single person that clicks on your Ad with the help of autoresponder services if you're not doing this within your campaigns you're seriously needing money on the table. And once you capture the lead that comes by clicking on your ad you can reach your customers by just sending out the single message whether its an email or as status update on your fanpage and in effect it can save you lots of money down the line. \u00a0\n\nNow for example if I was to run an ad on the Google ad network and I wanted to reach 50 people and they were charging me one dollar click it would cost me $50 to reach 50 people and lets say we're using Facebook Ad platform and we've run a campaign where 50 people have clicked on our Ad and if we are collecting the leads, those leads of those 50 people would then be saved into our database and we can then follow up with those 50 people are sending out a simple message an email and it will go out to those people and we won't have to spend $50 in future. \n\nSo this is something essential that you should be doing inside all of your campaigns.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNoR8HH4jZA", "Earn Money By Clicking And Breaking Egg \u25cf This App Scam or Not!\nEarn $5-$100 PayPal Cash By Breaking The Egg || Make Money -

In order to see success with your ads and to make a high return on investment on your campaigns targeting plays a big part, for example if I was to run a campaign and I want to target people that are interested in wine, If typed in wine, it shows it has an audience of 8,900,000 and just by selecting wine it gives us an estimated reach of over 400,000 people, this is not the best practice when targeting your areas of interest. Most people on the Facebook Ad platform are doing multiple word dumps, their interests are un targeted and too generic. You want to use the Facebook search box and typing your keywords and see which fanpages come back relating to those keywords and then you can go and like those pages and use those as precise interests when using your targeting. And each fan page seems to have it own bid price, and most people I'm not doing micro niche targeting, their just typing in a word like wine and targeting everything underneath that category and this is possibly a reason why they are not receiving the highest conversions with their ads. \n\nIn order to see maximum results from your campaign the best strategy is to develop a landing page to match the keywords that you target. This way you will definitely see an increase in conversions.\n\nFacebook Golden Tactic number three: Split Test and Maximise your return. Now running any campaigns on Facebook one thing to sure is that you split-test your campaigns that means taking one campaign and splitting up into several different parts, so you could have one image and then you could duplicate the image onto another campaign and use a different title and different body text but keep on using the same image. Then you could duplicate that again use the same title and the same body text but changed image around. What happens here is you start to see which add is more effective with your audience, and therefore you can keep on scrapping out the ones that are not doing well and you can move over to the ones that are performing well and you can split them again. So make sure that you split test and find out that winning campaign.\n\nFacebook golden tactic number 4 capture the lead. \n\nI've noticed that many marketers fail to do this. They are not capturing the leads when running any of their Facebook campaigns. You should try to capture the lead of every single person that clicks on your Ad with the help of autoresponder services if you're not doing this within your campaigns you're seriously needing money on the table. And once you capture the lead that comes by clicking on your ad you can reach your customers by just sending out the single message whether its an email or as status update on your fanpage and in effect it can save you lots of money down the line.  \n\nNow for example if I was to run an ad on the Google ad network and I wanted to reach 50 people and they were charging me one dollar click it would cost me $50 to reach 50 people and lets say we're using Facebook Ad platform and we've run a campaign where 50 people have clicked on our Ad and if we are collecting the leads, those leads of those 50 people would then be saved into our database and we can then follow up with those 50 people are sending out a simple message an email and it will go out to those people and we won't have to spend $50 in future. \n\nSo this is something essential that you should be doing inside all of your campaigns.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6ot8nHY3hc", "Here's exactly how to make money on youtube without ads, without monetization, without networks, without sponsors.\nYou don't need any of those if you do what I discuss in this video.\nProven and effective.\n\n\u201cWant to connect on facebook? Add me on Facebook: \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/aleksander.vitkin\n\nFollow me on Instagram: @aleksvitkin\u201d\n\nYou have probably seen other videos explaining how to make money on YouTube and they all say something about building a subscriber base, exchanging subscribers with other YouTubers and then getting paid by advertising or by sponsoring and you will be paid a few dollars per a thousand clicks.\n\nThat is the traditional way. That is not what I am going to talk about. That is not a very profitable business idea, unless you have hundreds of thousands of subscribers. I assume you do not and I do not have hundreds of thousands of subscribers either. \n\nI am going to give you a business model that works if you do not have hundreds of thousands of subscribers. You are going to be able to make more money with this business model than with adds on YouTube or anything like that. \n\nYou have probably never heard of this business model before. \n\nWhat if you took the people and instead of clicking the add they click on your link to go to your website. You can even have only a booking page on meetme.so (this is a website for booking pages), where they book a call with you. \n\nWhat is this call for? This call is not to just chat with you, but just to talk to you, so that you can give them a free consultation session and then you can sell them your coaching or a different product or service.\n\nWhy is this good? This is good, because even if you have a thousand of subscribers you will have enough people to build a six figure business. I am not talking random numbers here. This is what I have actually achieved. This is what actually works on YouTube. \n\nThis is what happens if you do not just focus on adds and hope that advertises pay you enough for your clicks to be able to make ends meet. This is making a real business and not just relying other people to send you a few dollars.\n\nWhat can you sell?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that you are an expert in one of the three big niches: health, wealth or money. How can you leverage your expertise into building a business and making money on YouTube?\n\nThe way to do that is to start making daily YouTube videos.\n\nIf you do not have a good camera, use your phone, put it on a tripod or hold it with your hand and have the light come to your face from a window. And then you start talking. \n\nYou can talk about subjects that you researched on Google keyword tool and you look up subjects in your niche. You have to create hundreds of videos in YouTube. This seems a lot of work and it is a lot of work.\n\nAsk people to subscribe to your YouTube channel. \n\nGenerally what happens is that you build a subscriber base and once in a while you make a video saying that you have an announcement and you are offering your coaching services. Then they will go to your link in an annotation or below in the description. \n\nThey will sign up to your call and then on the call you can sell them anything you want. And then you can learn how to deliver a service or a product. \n\nYou need to promote your videos on Facebook and slowly build an audience. This can explode any moment if one of your videos ranks on YouTube and suddenly you can get 300 subscribers per day.\n\nPeople are still hoping for those advertisement clicks, they sell their YouTube channels to networks. Even a channel with 170 000 subscribers earns only a couple of thousand dollars per month. That is not good compared to what you can do as a coach on YouTube who sells coaching or other packages or services on the phone to his YouTube subscribers. \n\nThis is a real business and this is how the big guys do it. If you can pull this off then do it, because I love this business model and so many people who I work with.\n\nThis is amazing business model and it is much better than YouTube adds.\n\nIf you like this video, please subscribe.

Each POF member gets to see the add 5 times. Ten Dollars per day results in 62,500 showings of the ad OR equal to 12,500 POF members. 1st question: What PERCENTAGE of POF members will click the ad? 20%, 10%, 1%, 0.0001% ? 1% would generate 125 clicks to the advertiser. The analytics of the advertiser shows the \"Average\" per view (EPC) at 4 cents. Therefore Per 10 dollars SPENT on POF the Gross Income from the advertiser (as averaged) nets 5 dollars From the Advertiser. That Becomes, AT a 1% rate, a Loss of $150 per Month. THE \"Missing\" link to \"Profits\", What are the Average Clicks per advertiser on POF? The EPC is what really counts, not the \"lead\" payment when your targeting the masses.", "This is very good information you gave us. I really appreciate.

However, I'm afraid a lot of people may watch this video and assume that the money is going to come rolling in as soon as they got their website set up. Obviously, if you are good at making YouTube videos and to make them look professional offering information that people want to watch then that is one way to make some money. However, it's easier said than done. You can always pay somebody to film the video for you but that's going to cost. If not, the the video yourself. But that will mean knowing how to edit videos, use software to add other bits and pieces to the video. And then you got to get people to watch your video. YouTube has been going for a long time now and there is just about every conceivable subject covered somewhere out there. So getting your videos seen is not going to happen overnight. But where you are absolutely spot on is advising people to do reviews if they can. I've done loads of videos on one of my channels and most of them haven't got many hits at all. However, I did a review of a pair of headphones a few months ago and it's obvious that people are out there looking for this type of information because the video has received over 2000 views and 25 likes with no negative clicks. I didn't do it with the intention to make money but I now realise that people are out there looking for information on things that they are thinking about buying. So if you've bought a speaker, or a bike, or a camera then make a video about it and he might be surprised how much interest it gets.\n\nA blog or website is an excellent way to make money from AdSense, especially if you can provide interesting information that people want to come and read. But again, you got to create information that people are interested in reading. You then got to attract the amount of people that is going to generate the Google AdSense revenue. There's no point in making a website about how to boil an egg or cook a chicken because there are already millions of websites out there with exactly the same information. Obviously if you have your own unique way of cooking a chicken or boiling an egg which is better than everyone else then you could be onto something. But again, because you've got a lot of competition it's going to take a lot of effort to get the website into a position of my people are going to see it. Personally, I think a niche is the easiest and quickest way to get a website up and running and get people on there quicker. At least with a niche where you are not competing with loads of other people you haven't got the competition to deal with. I would always tell people who want to start making money from AdSense to write about something they know and care about. It's much easier to write meaningful and interesting information if you know what you're talking about.

You must click on the claim button at least once a day to get daily bonuses but every hour will be the most effective way to get more satoshi's. While in coinpot wallet you can convert your different coins all into one. Choose between Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dash to have more satishi's of one coin. It is not loads of satoshi's so it will take a bit of time to start trading with them.\n\nOnce you have enough Satosh's you need to open up a bittrex account where you can send your satoshi's from coinpot wallet too to start your trading journey. Like I said before it will take some time to build up enough satoshi's to start. So the best place to buy satoshi' straight away is coinbase which you will need an account. Use this link for coinbase and if you purchase\u00a0$100\u00a0of Bitcoin satoshi's you will get\u00a0$10\u00a0extra (\u00a0https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a062292f8a4bc00bb76a658\u00a0).\n\nHere are the free satoshi sites for your coinpot wallet.\n\nhttp://moonbit.co.in/?ref=db559bacf606\n\nhttp://moondoge.co.in/?ref=b01a86ab49c9\n\nhttp://moonliteco.in/?ref=a1452b1eef14\n\nhttp://moondash.co.in/?ref=E752D886C312\n\nAlso these 2 extra sites will give you bonus bitcoin satoshi's into your coinpot wallet.\n\nhttp://bonusbitcoin.co/?ref=734CEFBA4C08\n\nhttp://bitfun.co/?ref=247443790B76\n\nAnother good wallet i think, is in the link below called Qoinpro. this is a wallet that gives you daily satosh's bonuses just for signing up to their wallet. No money is needed and the satosh's isn't alot. But you have nothing to lose because FREE is FREE.\n\nhttps://qoinpro.com/e7385911ae19e817b974857c93ce7b73\n\nPLEASE HAVE FUN COLLECTING YOUR FREE SATOSHI'S", "So, how much they pay u for posting this?", "Always with the same beginning joke.\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e", "How much wealth have you paid so far when using appcoiner?", "Guys I Swear I just got $3625.on.my paypal from this tool without paying anything:(just go to)~>http://freepplmon.club/?gO8zSa", "nice", "Is this a scam this site", "http://kusmoney.fun/2001235166360/\nt\u0131kla \u00fcye ol hi\u00e7 bir \u00fccret \u00f6deme bir\u015feyler satma g\u00fcnl\u00fck 100 dolar yada ayl\u0131k 3000 dolar kazan sadece g\u00fcnl\u00fck 2 3 saat evinde bilgisayar\u0131ndan \u00e7al\u0131\u015f", "Can we share in the hype http://newmillennialkingdom.com/webinar-registration-pagew3f2y56l", "Sub me and I'll sub u back", "Try #BigCash : The Highest Paying Reward App ever!

I am extremely angry at this point because I have put a tremendous amount of work on my channel doing reviews and posting links etc all for NOTHING and after a simple search I see tons of other people with the same problems and they are all calling the Amazon Affiliate program a SCAM as well! so maybe you should do some investigating, or at the very least warn that this is NOT for everyone like don't sign up if you have less than 1k subscribers, I even tried asking what the minimum \"followers\" are required to be eligible and to stop getting booted from the program and they said they didn't have an exact amount, sooo helpful.

Now, we all know that getting good quality backlinks along with good on-page SEO is very important to rank high in Google. But, other than that, we also know that Google sees how much time does a visitor spends on average on a page or blog post after clicking the result on Google's search results page. If that is so, if a visitor leaves a website within 6 seconds on average after clicking the result from search results page, Google will no longer rank that website higher in their results. Now, imagine a case where I got a blog post/page with a good article, ranking number 1 on Google's search results page for one of my favorite keywords. So, when people click and visit that particular blog post/page of mine from the search results and when they see a link within the very first 30 words of my article and click that link within 6 seconds that points to an another website will my blog post/page gets negatively affected in Google rankings as people went to an another website within 6 seconds by clicking the link on the very first 30 words of my article??? - Please note that I make all my out going links from my website to an another website \"open in a new tab\" format.

First of all, some people are acting like this guy is in their front yard protesting and screaming that all filters must be pre-filled. He is ONLY talking about a CLICKING NOISE that comes from THE ENGINE and starts right after an OIL CHANGE. He also gives SEVERAL different suggestions. So if you don't have a ticking noise then this doesn't apply. If you do have a ticking noise but it's not coming from the engine, then this doesn't apply. If you do have a ticking noise and it is coming from the engine, but you have not changed your oil recently, then this doesn't apply. So why dismiss his suggestion? It's a very valid point that he has - and considering it takes no effort, no time, and no cost to do this, why wouldn't you? And for my \"simple-minded\" comment, I am referring to the people who have absolutely no clue how to modify a suggestion or instructions to fit there unique situation. If you have a filter that screws in horizontally, pre-fill 1/2 or 1/3 with oil. It will soak it up, anyway. SOMETHING is better than NOTHING.

A bad alternator can damage other parts and make them mechanically fail....because there is not enough power being distributed properly to those parts to function at the speeds you are driving,, so everything starts to fail...many people don't know they are driving on a bad alternator until its too late...its best to buy a voltage meter reader to check it....once you get the alternator replaced if needed, then make sure other parts didnt get damaged....but just like me,, I had always kept up on oil changes, filter changes but thats won't keep the pump from failing.....thats a mechanical/electrical problem usually caused by bad alternators.", "Nice helpful video thanks \ud83d\udcaa", "Nice video but I have to respectfully disagree about the type of oil to use.

As the old saying goes Kansas, like many midwestern states, is as flat as a pancake. Somehow, pancakes became the golden standard for flatness, but do they really deserve such a title? A team of researchers from Texas State University and Arizona State University decided to find out. The researchers scientifically tested whether or not the state of Kansas was as flat as a pancake, and were surprised at what they found. Pancakes might be flat, but they are by no means the golden standard. The state of Kansas is actually flatter than a pancake. Who would have thought that was possible? The researchers figured this out by gathering data from the US Geological Survey about the topography of Kansas. They then obtained sample pancakes from none other than that breakfast staple, The International House of Pancakes. Armed with science and breakfast, the researchers headed into the lab. The researchers used a confocal laser microscope to compare the flatness quotient of a pancake to the USGS data about Kansas. For something to be perfectly flat (1.0) it would need to have no two points on its surface at different levels. A 2cm strip of pancake was placed under the microscope, and the researchers found that it was surprisingly inconsistent (0.957) with some sharp peaks and a lump in the center. Kansas, on the other hand, was pretty darn close to the perfectly flat designation, coming in at 0.9997. According to the researchers, this makes the state flatter than a pancake. Now, this isn\u2019t to say that Kansas is as flat as it gets, as it does fall short of perfect and there are bound to be some hills or other \u201cspikey\u201d things that would keep it from that designation, but the researchers were able to conclude that a pancake is shockingly bumpy and doesn\u2019t deserve to be the golden standard for flatness.*\n\n*The Earth is Not Moving! The heliocentric theory, literally \u201cflying\u201d in the face of direct observation, experimental evidence and common sense, maintains that the ball-Earth is spinning around its axis at 1,000 miles per hour, revolving around the Sun at 67,000 miles per hour, while the entire solar system rotates around the Milky Way galaxy at 500,000 miles per hour, and the Milky Way speeds through the expanding Universe at over 670,000,000 miles per hour, yet no one in history has ever felt a thing! We can feel the slightest breeze on a summer\u2019s day, but never one iota of air displacement from these incredible speeds! Heliocentrists claim with a straight face that their ball-Earth spins at a constant velocity dragging the atmosphere in such a manner as to perfectly cancel all centrifugal, gravitational, and inertial forces so we do not feel the tiniest bit of motion, perturbation, wind or air resistance! Such back-peddling, damage-control reverse-engineered explanations certainly stretch the limits of credibility and the imagination, leaving much to be desired by discerning minds. If the Earth and atmosphere are constantly revolving Eastwards at 1,000 mph, how is it that clouds, wind, and weather patterns casually and unpredictably go every which way, often travelling in opposing directions simultaneously? Why can we feel the slightest Westward breeze but not the Earth\u2019s incredible supposed 1,000 mph Eastward spin!? And how is it that the magic velcro of gravity is strong enough to drag miles of Earth\u2019s atmosphere along, but weak enough to allow little bugs, birds, clouds and planes to travel freely unabated in any direction?* \n\n*We must take it on faith as mathematical proof doesn't exist.* \n\n*N.A.S.A. on Speed:* \n*The Earth's orbital speed around the sun is 67,000 m.p.h.* \n*The sun's orbital speed around the galaxy is 450,000 m.p.h.* \n*The speed of the ground beneath your feet, as a result of the Earth's* *rotation is* \n*600 m.p.h. at the latitude of Sheffield (53 degrees);* \n \n*1,000 m.p.h. at the equator.* \n*The Earth travels 584 million miles per year (one trip around the sun); that's* \n\n*1,600,000 miles per day; 66,667 miles traveled each hour* \n\n*\u201cThe distance across St. George's Channel, between Holyhead and Kingstown Harbour, near Dublin, is at least 60 statute miles. It is not an uncommon thing for passengers to notice, when in, and for a considerable distance beyond the centre of the Channel, the Light on Holyhead Pier, and the Poolbeg Light in Dublin Bay.  The Lighthouse on Holyhead Pier shows a red light at an elevation of 44 feet above high water; and the Poolbeg Lighthouse exhibits two bright lights at an altitude of 68 feet; so that a vessel in the middle of the Channel would be 30 miles from each light; and allowing the observer to be on deck, and 24 feet above the water, the horizon on a globe would be 6 miles away. Deducting 6 miles from 30, the distance from the horizon to Holyhead, on the one hand, and to Dublin Bay on the other, would be 24 miles. The square of 24, multiplied by 8 inches, shows a declination of 384 feet. The altitude of the lights in Poolbeg Lighthouse is 68 feet; and of the red light on Holyhead Pier, 44 feet. Hence, if the earth were a globe, the former would always be 316 feet and the latter 340 feet below the horizon!\u201d -- Dr. Samuel Rowbotham,*  ~ *_Earth Not a Globe!_*\n\n*\u201cThe lights which are exhibited in lighthouses are seen by navigators at distances at which, according to the scale of the supposed \u2018curvature\u2019 given by astronomers, they ought to be many hundreds of feet, in some cases, down below the line of sight! For instance: the light at Cape Hatteras is seen at such a distance (40 miles) that, according to theory, it ought to be nine-hundred feet higher above the level of the sea than it absolutely is, in order to be visible! This is a conclusive proof that there is no \u2018curvature,\u2019 on the surface of the sea - \u2018the level of the sea,\u2019- ridiculous though it is to be under the necessity of proving it at all: but it is, nevertheless, a conclusive proof that the Earth is not a globe.\u201d -- William Carpenter,*\n\n*_100 Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe_*\n\nSurveyors, engineers and architects are never required to factor the supposed curvature of the Earth into their projects. Canals and railways, for example, are always cut and laid horizontally, often over hundreds of miles, without any allowance for curvature. (self.conspiracy)\n\nsubmitted 2 years ago  by slack-magician-boy\n\nThe London and Northwestern Railway forms a straight line 180 miles long between London and Liverpool. The railroad's highest point, midway at Birmingham station, is only 240 feet above sea-level. If the world were actually a globe, however, curving 8 inches per mile squared, the 180 mile stretch of rail would form an arc with the center point at Birmingham raising a full 5,400 feet above London and Liverpool. Adding the station's actual height (240 feet) to its theoretical inclination (5,400 feet) gives 5,640 feet as the rail's necessary height on a globe Earth, more than a thousand feet taller than Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in Great Britain.\n\n*The Suez Canal which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Gulf of Suez on the Red Sea is a clear proof of the Earth's and water's non-convexity. The canal is 100 miles long and without any locks so the water within is an uninterrupted continuation of the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. When it was constructed, the Earth's supposed curvature was not taken into account, it was dug along a horizontal datum line 26 feet below sea-level, passing through several lakes from one sea to the other, with the datum line and the water's surface running perfectly parallel over the 100 miles. The average level of the Mediterranean is 6 inches above the Red Sea, while the flood tides in the Red Sea rise 4 feet above the highest and drop 3 feet below the lowest in the Mediterranean, making the half-tide level of the Red Sea, the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, and the 100 miles of water in the canal, all a clear continuation of the same horizontal line! Were they instead the supposed curved line of globe-Earthers, the water in the center of the canal would be 1666 feet (502 x 8 inches = 1666 feet 8 inches) above the respective Seas on either side!*", "\u2702 *WATCH MY ARREST*\nhttps://youtu.be/e_iy4V9Dqko\n*Here I am being arrested for contempt of court*\n*(and getting sentenced to 30 days in jail for it)*\n*for calling judge Belle B.

Rockstar FIXED (read: REMOVED) this glitch in version update 1.04 (which is 1.20 for GTAO). For this to work, you MUST be on current-gen PS4 or Xbox One (no PC) using an earlier version of the game (versions 1.01-1.03 would work but you cannot update to them anymore). So, basically, it means you need an UN-UPDATED version of GTA5 on current-gen consoles -- if you update the game, this will NOT work. \n\nThis video is not really a tutorial, either. Sorry =( This is the original live gameplay video showing when I discovered the glitch. It was the very 1st time I re-produced it. If you check the upload date, you can see it's 2 days after the game released; then, Rockstar patched the glitch 6 days later. But if you install (and don't update) the original GTA 5 current-gen version of the game, this glitch will FOREVER work and will always ALWAYS WORK.\n\nIt's 100% guaranteed to work and repeatable IF you're using the original current-gen console version of the game. If it's NOT working for you, please try:\n\nTHINGS TO TRY IF IT DOES NOT WORK:\n\n-make sure you're on PS4 or Xbox One\n-make sure your patch version is 1.05 or older (Rockstar fixed/removed this bug a few months after GTA V current-gen released)\n-make sure you're using Lifeinvader after it has crashed\n-- try progress the story past Fame or Shame so that Lifeinvader is 'crashed' but also now 'randomly recovering/fluctuating'\n--- the glitch doesn't always work if a stock is 'stuck crashing' ... it needs to be crashed to a very low negative return of probably over -70% but still be able to change (e.g. when you reload a save over and over and over, each time Lifeinvader will be a different 'crashed' value)\n\n*this video and all my attempts are done after Dead Man Walking but I've heard that it works earlier right after Heist 1 (on Trevor) or immediately after the Lifeinvader mission soon as the stock crashes. But if the glitch is NOT working for you, try to progress the mission story farther.\n**switching characters may help but isn't always required. \n\nABOUT THE VIDEO:\n\nI apologize that the video is overly long and confusing. This was not expected to be a tutorial video and I did not expect anyone other than a few people at GTAForums or NeoGAF to see it.\n\nThe video is the 1st time I re-produced the glitch. I actually noticed on day 1 crashed stocks seemed buggy but I didn't understand it yet. I kept experimenting casually after the 1st Heist, and then I discovered it. If you check the upload date of the video, it's barely even 2 days after the game released. It's the 1st video on Youtube showing the glitch. \n \nThis video is the very first time I re-produced it. So, I quickly PS Shared it with some friends on a couple message boards. I didn't expect more than a few friends to see it.\n\nSo, I apologize if it's unclear and I'm sorry if it's confusing or useless enough to anyone that they feel the need to Dislike the video. I didn't upload it to waste peoples time. My intention was just, 'Hey, I think I just found a stock market glitch, pretty sure I can reproduce it... check it out.\" Since then obviously the glitch was understood a bit better. \n\nAlso, there are a few newer videos made by other people and those are really helpful tutorials. I think one of the other top search results is very clear and better presented, so if my video is too confusing, I recommend some of the others. \n\nMine isn't really the same thing because this video isn't a tutorial -- it's almost like raw footage of the first time that the glitch was reproduced and uploaded to Youtube.\n\nThanks for all the views and I'm always happy to try help with the glitch if you have any questions.

I registered this morning, filled out my profile questions, and received 5 points. Within minutes, my email was bombarded with emails to take surveys. I was thinking, \"Fantastic!! I'd love to do surveys on and off all day and earn extra money!!\" However, there are pre-screening questions to each and every survey, which can, in itself, be time consuming. For me, most of my questions had to do with medical, or whether I smoked or consumed alcohol. Once I got past the pre-screening questions for each survey, it would tell me how many points the survey was worth, and the expected length. Once I clicked on \"begin survey\", it would take a bit to have the next screen come up, which would say, \"I'm sorry, we already have enough people who have done the survey\"\".

This song has amazing  lyrics!   The bottom line is Everyone will face pain in life.  Its unavoidable.  Life is full of ups and downs.  Coming up short, failure, disappointment, unable to reach one's goals.  People must set their own goals in life, however.  Life will be EXTREMELY  painful if one lets society set one's goals.    Secondly, failure must be met with love, compassion, grace, and forgiveness.  We can all agree that failure is a part of life.  If failure is not accepted as okay, then pain will emerge.  Pain is a result of failure, failing to meet one's expectations, and a potential need for a change in one's goals.  If not, the pain will remain and one must find a way to accept one's failures, one's weaknesses, one's shortcomings, one's disappointment, one who may have been abused.  If no realization, then the PAIN will remain.  IT REQUIRES BEING HUMBLE WITH WHO ONE IS!   Simply being human.  Forgiving.                    OKAY!  You may not be able to accept your weaknesses or deal with the pain.  You may not want to accept a lack of control.  I may not want to accept humbleness, may not want to accept that you have been wronged, victimized.   You may prefer to hide from reality.                     You can hide from the PAIN!  Its easy. . . . with alcohol, drugs, addiction, with materialism, shopping, accumulation, with isolation, with egocentric behaviors, greed, or all the above.  Nevertheless, the pain will not be lessened.  It will accumulate. .  . .  It will eventually raise its head like a monster and find its way into your world.  Pain instead of love.  The pain will eventually be released into one's life.  It will interfere with love.  Sneaking its way into your relationships with your most treasured loved ones.              Despite the pain, the lyrics explain at the end of the song, that the soul is pure.  The poet does not want to become someone else minus one's past or pain.  Instead the poet wants to remain the person he is today.  One who has been humbled by failure, mistreatment, and . . . finally, one who has received healing . . . .GRACE.

But let this not blind you to what virtue there is. Many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. \nBe yourself. Especially do not feign affection.

His command to His creation being that we love God, obey His Commandments and love our neighbor as ourselves.\n\nThat same testament from our Creator says that love is sacrifice.

We sacrifice selflessly for what we love.\n\nThe Bible also states that our Creator will teach all who come to Him in humility and contrition. That the very Spirit of God will indwell us and lead us into all truth, if we make ourselves a suitable dwelling place for it.\n\nThe Created, seeking answers about itself, without a Creator is futile and it is folly. \n\nMankind putting himself in the place of God is the source of every evil in the world since the beginning of time.\n\nBut don't believe me.

What I take from it is that economies are handled in ways that protect the interests of corporate and other wealthy elites. Given the four mechanisms through which to respond to deleveraging (austerity, debt restructuring, redistribution, printing money/QE) - two are unequivocally elitist: austerity and QE, as the former cuts down on public spending which by definition tends to help lower income groups (social security and programmes, state education, healthcare, etc) and the latter 'bails out' or protects the at-risk bank assets. The more you do both, it seems to be argued, the less you apparently need to restructure debt fairly (the majority of cases this is done only to protect bank losses rather than help recovery - see Greece) or more importantly redistribute wealth.

Glad to see so many Socialists expressing our true ideals to others.\n\nSocialism is often reduced in argument to government control and interference of the market. Some even think that Socialism simply means social welfare.. Thing is, it's not! Socialism is the collective ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.\n\nIt works like a charm. Multiple communities have taken up Socialism and benefited immensely due to it. Now only if the whole world could. Pity that it'll never happen. Humanity is more likely to destroy itself- which it very well could in our lifetime- than to reach a Utopian Socialist society. And all because the status quo will never change. People are either too stubborn to see the benefits of Socialism or too ill-informed to derive meaningful contemplation of the ideal.\n\nIn fact, if it were not for my study of the subject, I would have accepted the phony definition of Socialism taught to me in school. When you cannot even understand what a concept truly implies how can you be trusted to formulate an opinion on it? And so this is why we see a renewed interest and debate of Socialism today. Socialism has been painted as though all it equates to is social welfare, so thus you see thousands of Social Democrats joining up, because who doesn't love welfare? Certainly Anarchist Capitalists! \n\nA further critique of the education system is the choice to differentiate between Socialism and Communism as ideological facets. Communism today just equates to what Socialist theory calls Marxism. They are interchangeable. So what is the difference between Socialism and Marxism? Well, Marxism is a school of Socialism, so it shouldn't be considered a separate ideology for that reason. They both aim for the same goals, but Marxism requires the State to deliver Collectivisation, whereas Libertarian Socialists do not require any State. Not all Marxist states have failed, a good example is Burkina Faso. However, Marxism is fundamentally flawed in the fact that it does allow for horrible regimes such as that of Stalin and Mao Zedong to take power. \n\nOur youths have been ill-informed, and frankly so have politicians like Bernie Sanders. You would think the man, with nearly 80 years of age, would have had enough time to read up on actual Socialist theory! Nope, the guy is just another moderate and we don't need one. But I suppose if a \"Socialist\" gets in office, we could see far more people actually studying the ideology rather than accepting this bogus definition. \n\nPerhaps I should go out and record a video of the public defining Socialism and Communism. It could be telling as to how many of suffer from this misunderstanding. Sounds like it could be highly entertaining as well. Then I could help to inform them of the truth and everyone will get a big grin and a chuckle out of them. Seems like too intrusive and controversial of a topic for any family content however. \n\nEven if you don't agree with my spiel, I hope everyone has learned something from this wonderful video.

Of course I was sent to the principal's office and he asked me: \"Why don't you want to pledge allegiance? Everybody does.\" I said: \"Everybody once believed the Earth was flat but, that doesn't make it so.\" I explained that America owed everything it has to other cultures and other nations, and that I would rather pledge allegiance to the Earth and everyone on it. Needless to say, it wasn't long before I left school entirely. I set up a lab in my bedroom. There, I began to learn about science and nature. I realized then that the universe is governed by laws, and that the human being, along with society itself, was not exempt from these laws. Then came the crash of 1929, which began with what we now call \"The Great Depression.\" I found it difficult to understand why millions were out of work, homeless, starving, while all the factories were sitting there, the resources were unchanged. It was then that I realized that the rules of the economic game were inherently invalid. Shorty after came World War II, where various nations took turns, systematically destroying each other. I later calculated that all the destruction and wasted resources spent on that war could've easily provided for every human need on the planet. Since that time, I've watched humanity set the stage for its own extinction. I have watched as the precious, finite resources are perpetually wasted and destroyed in the name of profit and free markets. I have watched the social values of society be reduced into a base artificiality of materialism and mindless consumption. And I have watched as the monetary powers control the political structure of supposedly \"free societies.\" I'm 94 years old now and I'm afraid my disposition is the same as it was 75 years ago:\u00a0this shit's got to go.", "I don't feel a connection to the world at all and feel like I never have.", "lol I was like let's see what they've got to say.

Many people in the forum suggested you to check interference at the crank, the cable, the chain, or whatever..

(By switching back to other pedal, if you have one, you notice that it's solved; but of course you really want to use the new, carbon 105 pedal that looks really nice and slick..).. Again, it's the faulty axes that cause it.. Either the tolerance wasn't well designed or the material is weak that the axes and the bearing has too much play to cause the clicking...\nSolution: get a 5700 axes (not the new 5800 axes).

Ten Dollars per day results in 62,500 showings of the ad OR equal to 12,500 POF members. 1st question: What PERCENTAGE of POF members will click the ad? 20%, 10%, 1%, 0.0001% ? 1% would generate 125 clicks to the advertiser. The analytics of the advertiser shows the \"Average\" per view (EPC) at 4 cents. Therefore Per 10 dollars SPENT on POF the Gross Income from the advertiser (as averaged) nets 5 dollars From the Advertiser. That Becomes, AT a 1% rate, a Loss of $150 per Month.

However, I'm afraid a lot of people may watch this video and assume that the money is going to come rolling in as soon as they got their website set up. Obviously, if you are good at making YouTube videos and to make them look professional offering information that people want to watch then that is one way to make some money. However, it's easier said than done. You can always pay somebody to film the video for you but that's going to cost. If not, the the video yourself. But that will mean knowing how to edit videos, use software to add other bits and pieces to the video. And then you got to get people to watch your video. YouTube has been going for a long time now and there is just about every conceivable subject covered somewhere out there. So getting your videos seen is not going to happen overnight. But where you are absolutely spot on is advising people to do reviews if they can. I've done loads of videos on one of my channels and most of them haven't got many hits at all. However, I did a review of a pair of headphones a few months ago and it's obvious that people are out there looking for this type of information because the video has received over 2000 views and 25 likes with no negative clicks. I didn't do it with the intention to make money but I now realise that people are out there looking for information on things that they are thinking about buying. So if you've bought a speaker, or a bike, or a camera then make a video about it and he might be surprised how much interest it gets.\n\nA blog or website is an excellent way to make money from AdSense, especially if you can provide interesting information that people want to come and read. But again, you got to create information that people are interested in reading. You then got to attract the amount of people that is going to generate the Google AdSense revenue. There's no point in making a website about how to boil an egg or cook a chicken because there are already millions of websites out there with exactly the same information. Obviously if you have your own unique way of cooking a chicken or boiling an egg which is better than everyone else then you could be onto something. But again, because you've got a lot of competition it's going to take a lot of effort to get the website into a position of my people are going to see it. Personally, I think a niche is the easiest and quickest way to get a website up and running and get people on there quicker. At least with a niche where you are not competing with loads of other people you haven't got the competition to deal with. I would always tell people who want to start making money from AdSense to write about something they know and care about. It's much easier to write meaningful and interesting information if you know what you're talking about.

It is not loads of satoshi's so it will take a bit of time to start trading with them.\n\nOnce you have enough Satosh's you need to open up a bittrex account where you can send your satoshi's from coinpot wallet too to start your trading journey. Like I said before it will take some time to build up enough satoshi's to start. So the best place to buy satoshi' straight away is coinbase which you will need an account. Use this link for coinbase and if you purchase\u00a0$100\u00a0of Bitcoin satoshi's you will get\u00a0$10\u00a0extra (\u00a0https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a062292f8a4bc00bb76a658\u00a0).\n\nHere are the free satoshi sites for your coinpot wallet.\n\nhttp://moonbit.co.in/?ref=db559bacf606\n\nhttp://moondoge.co.in/?ref=b01a86ab49c9\n\nhttp://moonliteco.in/?ref=a1452b1eef14\n\nhttp://moondash.co.in/?ref=E752D886C312\n\nAlso these 2 extra sites will give you bonus bitcoin satoshi's into your coinpot wallet.\n\nhttp://bonusbitcoin.co/?ref=734CEFBA4C08\n\nhttp://bitfun.co/?ref=247443790B76\n\nAnother good wallet i think, is in the link below called Qoinpro. this is a wallet that gives you daily satosh's bonuses just for signing up to their wallet. No money is needed and the satosh's isn't alot. But you have nothing to lose because FREE is FREE.\n\nhttps://qoinpro.com/e7385911ae19e817b974857c93ce7b73\n\nPLEASE HAVE FUN COLLECTING YOUR FREE SATOSHI'S", "So, how much they pay u for posting this?", "Always with the same beginning joke.\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e", "How much wealth have you paid so far when using appcoiner?", "Guys I Swear I just got $3625.on.my paypal from this tool without paying anything:(just go to)~>http://freepplmon.club/?gO8zSa", "nice", "Is this a scam this site", "http://kusmoney.fun/2001235166360/\nt\u0131kla \u00fcye ol hi\u00e7 bir \u00fccret \u00f6deme bir\u015feyler satma g\u00fcnl\u00fck 100 dolar yada ayl\u0131k 3000 dolar kazan sadece g\u00fcnl\u00fck 2 3 saat evinde bilgisayar\u0131ndan \u00e7al\u0131\u015f", "Can we share in the hype http://newmillennialkingdom.com/webinar-registration-pagew3f2y56l", "Sub me and I'll sub u back", "Try #BigCash : The Highest Paying Reward App ever!
